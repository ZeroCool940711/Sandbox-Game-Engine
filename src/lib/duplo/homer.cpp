	 *	The attribute arrivalCountLimit is used to limit the number of times an
	 *	model may need to move a smaller distance than that required by the
	 *	frame duration and speed to reach the target (ie the last frame before
	 *	it reaches the target). This acts to trigger the proximity callback,
	 *	even if the model is not within proximity distance of the target. This
	 *	is a failsafe so that if the proximity is too small it acts to stop the
	 *	Homer from "buzzing" around its target - in effect never reaching it
	 *	target because the model's position cannot move close enough to the
	 *	target to get inside its proximity radius.
	 *	@type Integer. Default is 1.

	 *	be scaled linearly over scaleTime seconds to reach the specified scale.
	 *	When the model reaches half-way point of its trip (based on its
	 *	movement duration as a fraction of tripTime), it scales back to its
