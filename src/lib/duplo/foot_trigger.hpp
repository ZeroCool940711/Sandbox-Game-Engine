/*~ class BigWorld.FootTrigger
 *
 *	A FootTrigger is a PyAttachment which can be attached to nodes in a model
 *	to test for them hitting the ground.  It is capable of both creating
 *	particles from a SourcePSA which it stores, and also calling a function on
 *	each footstep.
 *
 *	The FootTrigger works by tracking the height of the node it is attached
 *	to, relative to a rest position. Whenever this height gets bellow a given
 *	threshold, the trigger does a coarse collision test for a potential
 *	footstep. The test is performed againt any object in the collision scene
 *	which the trigger approaches from above. This includes terrain, shells and
 *	static models. It doesn't include entities, however. If the collision test
 *	yields true, a footstep is flagged. The threshold level can be set using
 *	the field &lt;environment/footprintThreshold&gt; in resources.xml.
 *
 *	In normal biped usage, two would be used, one attached to the right foot node,
 *	one to the left.  More than two can be used, however, the odd attribute is
 *	treated as boolean, so processing of leg specific effects is limited to
 *	right and left.
 *
 *	FootTriggers are created by the BigWorld.FootTrigger() function.
 *
 *	Example:
 *	@{
 *	leftTrigger  = BigWorld.FootTrigger( 1 )
 *	rightTrigger = BigWorld.FootTrigger( 0 )
 *	# dustSourcePSA is the particle system action to create the dust
 *	leftTrigger.dustSource =  dustSourcePSA
 *	rightTrigger.dustSource = dustSourcePSA
 *	# model is the model we want to add FootTriggers to
 *	lfoot = model.node( "biped R Foot" )
 *	rfoot = model.node( "biped L Foot" )
 *  lfoot.attach( leftTrigger )
 *  rfoot.attach( rightTrigger )
 *	@}
