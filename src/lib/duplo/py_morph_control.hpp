/*~ class BigWorld.PyMorphControl
 *
 *	This class is used to blend morph targets onto a PyModel, using blend
 *	weights specified in a MatrixProvider.  The list of morph targets
 *	is specified by the targetNames attribute, the MatrixProvider is 
 *	specified by the input attribute.
 *
 *	To apply the PyMorphControl to a model, it should be assigned to an
 *	arbitrarily named attribute of that model.  In order to function 
 *	correctly, the named morph targets should all have been exported as part
 *	of the model's primitives.
 *	
 *	If more than one PyMorphControl is applied to a model at once, then
 *	the morph targets of both of them are weighted together.
 *
 *	A new PyMorphControl is created using the BigWorld.PyMorphControl function.
 *
 *	For example:
 *	@{
 *	mat = Math.Matrix()
 *	mat.setElement( 0, 0, 2.0 ) # set the blend weight for "openLips" to 2.0
 *	mat.setElement( 0, 1, 1.0 ) # set the blend weight for "closedLips" to 1.0
 *	self.model.myMorphControl = BigWorld.PyMorphControl()
 *	self.model.myMorphControl.input = mat
 *	self.model.myMorphContro.targetNames = [ "openLips", "closedLips" ]
 *	@}
 *	This example sets the model to have its lips two thirds open,
 *	assuming that the two named morph targets existed on the model.
