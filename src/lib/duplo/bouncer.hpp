/*~ class BigWorld.Bouncer
 *
 *	Bouncer is a Motor that causes the model to move with an initial velocity 
 *	(vx, vy, vz) in a balistic trajectory, following the laws of motion and
 *	bouncing against the collision scene until it eventually comes to rest. 
 *
 *	It is designed to work in a lagged network environment so that the player 
 *	originally activating the bouncer can get immediate feedback, being able to 
 *	see the balistic projectile without having to wait for the server to return 
 *	its correct final path, while still getting an end result that is consistent 
 *	with that on the server and all witnessing clients.
 *
 *	This is achieved by allowing the original client to estimate the object's
 *	path (using estimatePath) and start animating it right away. When the final 
 *	authoritative trajectory arrives from the server, the two paths are blended 
 *	together over time (using updatePath), so that the final position on the
 *	client is the same as the one returned by the server.
 *
 *	Clients witnessing the balistic object will animate the server-computed 
 *	trajectory from the begining (using calcPath).
 *
 *	Example: 
 *	@{
 *		def throwGrenade(self):
 *			# when throwing the grenade
 *			motor = BigWorld.Bouncer()
 *			motor.vx = throwSpeed[0]
 *			motor.vy = throwSpeed[1]
 *			motor.vz = throwSpeed[2]
 *			motor.tripTime  = Grenade.FUSETIME # no point in simulating past explosion time
 *			motor.timeSlice = 1.0 / 30.0
 *			motor.estimatePath( owner.position, ELASTICITY, RADIUS, MAX_BOUNCES)
 *	
 *			model = BigWorld.Model(GRENADE_MODEL)
 *			model.motors = [motor]
 *			(...)
 *
 *		def enterWorld(self):
 *			if self.ownerId == BigWorld.player().id:
 *				# update existing motor
 *				(...)
 *				model.motors[0].updatePath(
 *					self.clientSourcePos, 
 *					self.serverSourcePos,
 *					self.destinationPos)
 *			else:
 *				# witnessing grenade being thrown
 *				(...)
 *				motor = BigWorld.Bouncer()
 *				motor.vx = self.throwSpeed[0]
 *				motor.vy = self.throwSpeed[1]
 *				motor.vz = self.throwSpeed[2]
 *				motor.tripTime  = self.fusetime 
 *				motor.timeSlice = 1.0 / 30.0
 *				motor.calcPath( 
 *					currentOwnerPosition, self.serverSourcePos,
 *					self.destPos, ELASTICITY, RADIUS, MAX_BOUNCES)
