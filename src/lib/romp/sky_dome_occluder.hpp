/**
 * This class implements the PhotonOccluder interface, and provides
 * occlusion information for lens flares, especially the sun flare.
 *
 * It works by setting the "OcclusionTestEnable" flag as an effect
 * constant so that the existing sky domes, whatever they may be, can
 * be drawn again using special alpha-test occlusion pass.
 *
 * In order to capture the occlusion information, a view matrix is
 * constructed that makes the camera look directly at the sun; this
 * has the effect of drawing all possible sun occluders directly in
 * the middle of the screen.  A scissors rectangle is used to clip these
 * results to the size of the sun, and directX occlusion queries are
 * used to record how many pixels of sun are visible.
