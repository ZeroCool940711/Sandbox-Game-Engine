	 *	These methods compress and decompress an image of floats to and from a

	 *	loss of	precision.  Repeated compressions and decompressions however is 
	 *	stable.  The decompression method should be able to handle older 
	 *	formats but the	compression method always compresses using the best 
	 *	known compression method.  Currently the compression is done by 
	 *	quantizing the heights to 1mm intervals and compressing the resultant 
	 *	integerized height map using PNG.  Typically this gives a compression 
	 *	ratio of 8:1.
