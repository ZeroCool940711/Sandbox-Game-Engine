	/*~ class GUI.GuiAttachment
	 *
	 *	This class is a basic adaptor between PyAttachment and SimpleGUIComponent.
	 *
	 *	If you wish to display gui elements in the 3D scene ( and sorted into the scene )
	 *	then use this class as a container for your gui hierarchy, and attach this object
	 *	onto a PyModel or other PyAttachment object.
	 *
	 *	Note that if you wish to receive input like most gui components, then you can still
	 *	use the attached gui component's focus property as per normal.
	 *
	 *		eg,	guiSomeImage = GUI.Simple(imageFile)
	 *			guiAttach = GUI.Attachment()
	 *			guiAttach.component = guiSomeImage
	 *			self.model.rightHand = guiAttach	# Where rightHand is PyModelNode (model hard-point)
	 *			GUI.addRoot(guiSomeImage)
	 *
	 *		Current Model will now run around with the image showing in its right hand...
