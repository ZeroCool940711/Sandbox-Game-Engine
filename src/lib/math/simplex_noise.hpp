/**
 *	SimplexNoise is a class that generates simplex noise based upon Perlin's
 *	improvement to the Perlin noise algorithm.  The implementation is based 
 *	upon Stefan Gustavson's implementation as in:
 *
 *		http://staffwww.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf
 *
 *	There are two ways of using this noise.  Most simply you can call
 *	
 *		SimplexNoise::generate(x, y, seed),
 *
 *	which generates noise in the range [0, 1] on a 1-unit scale.
 *
 *	The second method is to use the SimplexNoise class.  This lets you set up
 *	a collection of octaves of noise, including their frequencies, relative
 *	weights, the output range and a linear lookup which can be used to 
 *	accentuate, de-emphasize etc noise values.
