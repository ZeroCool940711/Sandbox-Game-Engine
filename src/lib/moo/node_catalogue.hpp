 *	This class implements a global node catalogue.  It allows visuals
 *	and animations to share node storage
 *	This allows some memory and performance optimisations, as multiple
 *	models sharing a skeleton need only animate once, and multiple models
 *	using similarly named nodes do not have multiple copies of the node.
 *	These optimisations are made at the expense of having node traversal
 *	information overwritten by each successive traversal.  This symptom
 *	is most noticeable in that PyModelNodes need to copy world transforms
 *	from the nodes as they animate instead of pointing to the state of
 *	the existing node.
