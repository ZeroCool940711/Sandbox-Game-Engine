/**
 *	To enable support for speedtree in BigWorld, define SPEEDTREE_SUPPORT as 1. 
 *	To disable the feature, define it as 0. When speedtree suport is disabled, 
 *	objects and classes from src/lib/speedtree can still be used, but they will
 *	have empty implementation. To avoid interrupting the execution of its client
 *	code, it will not generate errors, trigger asserts or throw exceptions, but
 *	it will print warnings to the debug output.
 *
 *	To build BigWorld with support for SpeedTree, you will need SpeedTreeRT SDK 
 *	4.2 or later installed and a current license. For detailed instructions on how 
 *	to setup SpeedTreeRT SDK, please refer to client_and_tools_build_instructions.html 
 *	in (bigworld/doc).
