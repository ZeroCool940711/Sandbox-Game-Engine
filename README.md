# "The Sandbox Game Engine"

Our goal is to make a Game Engine where everything you need to make a game is included, from common assets to tools that will improve your work and reduce the time needed to finish a project.

Many games need assets that are pretty common, our game engine will use procedural generation to create these assets for you so instead of spending time modeling those things you can spend that time and money on other areas like gameplay or UI design, here are some of those assets we plan to include and some features our engine already has:
- Rocks (Procedural Generated Rocks)
- Buildings (schools, hospitals, destroyed buildings, etc)
- Medieval and Modern houses.
- Trees (We already have generators for 700 types of trees and more will be created later)
- Animations (We have around 3000 animations ready to be used right now)
- Procedural Textures for terrain painting and for models.
- Ropes and Ivys that adapt to the terrain and objects.
- Barrels and Boxes.
- Procedural Generated Human Characters.
- Physics, Material Aging and Plant Growing System.
- Weather system with 24 hour cycle and realistic weather conditions.
- Python and C++ scripting: Python will be used for easy prototyping as its an easy to use and learn and C++ for tasks where performance is needed.
- Client and Server for MMO games included as well as tools for debugging and administration of such games.
- Easy clustering tools to scale your game server easily.
- Umbra support as well as a custom Object Culling algorithms included to improve game performance.
- Terrain Chunking System designed to remove the terrain size limit and allowing developers to create Open World games easily.
