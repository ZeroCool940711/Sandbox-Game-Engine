/*~ class BigWorld.Filter
 *
 *	This is the abstract base class for all Filter objects.  Filters are used

 *	between server updates of these variables.
 *
 *	The only functionality defined in the base class is the reset function,
 *	which resets the filter to have its current time set to the specified time.
 *
 *	Every entity has a filter attribute.  Assigning a filter to that attribute
 *	sets that entity to be the owner of the specified filter.  This will make
 *	the filter process server updates for that entity.

/**
 *	This class forms the bass of all filters in BigWorld.\n
 *	Filters are components attached to entities to process updates to the
 *	entity's 'volatile'  members. These include position, yaw, pitch and roll.
 *	Volatile members are different to other entity members in that their
 *	transmission to clients is 'best effort' as apposed to the 'reliable'
 *	fashion most members are updated. In addition to this the frequency of
 *	updates is affected with distance to the player. It is the responsibility
 *	of filters to take these inputs and produce a visually pleasing movement of
 *	the entity.

 *	@note:	The network layer will sometimes provided positions that are
 *	'on ground' and will need to have their \f$y\f$ coordinate sampled from the
 *	terrain at the given \f$(x,z)\f$. They will appear as positions with a
 *	\f$y\f$ component approximately equal to -13000.
