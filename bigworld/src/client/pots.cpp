/*~ function BigWorld.addPot
 *
 *	This function adds a player-only trap to the active list of traps.  This
 *	trap will trigger if the player entity moves either into or out of the 
 *	sphere of specified radius and centre.  When it triggers, it will call
 *	the specified callable object, with two arguments, the first of which
 *	is 0 if the player moved out of the sphere, and 1 if the player moved
 *	into the sphere.  The second is the handle of the trap, which is the
 *	number returned by the addPot function.
 *	See Entity.addTrap for a trap that works on all entities.
 *
 *	For example:
 *	@{
 *	# the callback function
 *	def hitPot( enteredTrap, handle ):
 *		if enteredTrap:
 *			print "The player entered the sphere for trap number ", handle
 *		else:
 *			print "The player left the sphere for trap number ", handle
 *
 *	# Note: player.matrix is the players current position
 *	BigWorld.addPot( BigWorld.player().matrix, 5.0, hitPot )
 *	@}
 *	In this example, the hitPot function will get called whenever the player enters
 *	or leaves a stationary sphere with a radius of 5 metres (the position of the
 *	sphere is centred around where the player was when the addPot function was called).
 *
 *	@param	centre	a MatrixProvider.  This is the centre of the sphere.
 *	@param	radius	a float.  This is the radius of the sphere to trap.
 *	@param	callback	a callable object.  This is the function that gets
 *			called when the trap is triggered.
 *
 *	@return an integer.  The handle of the trap.
