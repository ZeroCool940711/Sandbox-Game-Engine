/*~ class BigWorld.BoidsFilter
 *
 *	This subclass of AvatarFilter implements a filter which implements flocking
 *	behaviour for the models that make up an entity.  This would normally
 *	be used for an entity such as a flock of birds or a school of fish which
 *	has many models driven by one entity.
 *
 *	The interpolation of the Entity position is done using the same logic
 *	as its parent AvatarFilter.  However, it also updates the positions
 *	of individual models (which are known, according to flocking conventions,
 *	as boids) that are attached to the entity, using standard
 *	flocking rules.
 *
 *	When the flock lands, the boidsLanded method is called on the entity.
 *
 *	A new BoidsFilter is created using the BigWorld.BoidsFilter function.
