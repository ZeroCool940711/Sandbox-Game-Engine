 *	This is a specialised AvatarFilter that places its owner on the ground.
 *	It is intended for use with  navigating entities which have a tendency
 *	to hover above the ground as they follow the navigation mesh. \n\n
 *	
 *	@note	Currently the dropping is performed on input rather than output
 *			because it is less frequent and so cheaper. However this does
 *			mean that entities will clip through hills during periods of sparse
 *			input.
