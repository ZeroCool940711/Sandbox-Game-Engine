 *  
 *  It is not possible to directly access many of the internal attributes of 
 *  an EntityDirProvider. To view this data it is necessary to construct a 
 *  Matrix which is a copy of this, & read the values from it. For 
 *  example:
 *  @{
 *  # create an EntityDirProvider which provides the direction faced by the 
 *  # entity anEntity
 *  edp = BigWorld.EntityDirProvider( anEntity, 1, 0 )
 *  
 *  # create a Matrix from the EntityDirProvider
 *  m = Math.Matrix( edp )
 *
 *  # print the yaw
 *  print m.yaw
 *  @}
 *  Note that a Matrix constructed as a copy of an EntityDirProvider 
 *  will only resemble the EntityDirProvider at the time that it is created. It
 *  will not update to reflect changes.
 *
 *  Instances of this class are typically used in conjunction with a Tracker to
 *  turn nodes in a model towards an entity's facing direction.
