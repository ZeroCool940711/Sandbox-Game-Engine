/*~ class BigWorld.PyServer
 *  A PyServer is the device through which an entity is able to call methods
 *  on it's instance on a server. BigWorld creates two PyServer objects
 *  as attributes for each client entity, "cell" and "base", which can be
 *  used to send method calls to the entity's cell and base instances,
 *  respectively. These cannot be created in script.
 *
 *  PyServer objects have no default attributes or methods, however BigWorld
 *  populates them with ServerCaller objects which represent the methods that
 *  can be called. These are built using information provided in the entity
 *  def files. A ServerCaller object can then be called as if it were the
 *  method that it represents, which causes it to add a request to call the
 *  appropriate function on the next bundle that is sent to the server.
 *
 *  This is not supported for licensees who have not licensed the BigWorld
 *  server technology.
