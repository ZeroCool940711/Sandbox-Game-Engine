Here you will find a skeleton of how to create an Entity Extra and an
Entity Controller.

Entity extras provide a mechanism for adding additional methods to
all BigWorld cell entities. They provide a means to add facilities to
BigWorld such as navigation and vision.

Controllers provide a standard method to perform high-computation work
on entity properties in C++. They are useful for performing actions over
a period of time that are infeasible to implement in Python.

See chapter "Entity Extras and Controllers" in the Server Programming
Guide for more information.
