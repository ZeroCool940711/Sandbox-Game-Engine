/*~ class NoModule.PyEntities
 *  @components{ cell }
 *  An instance of PyEntities emulates a dictionary of PyEntity objects, 
 *  indexed by its id attribute. It does not support item assignment, but can
 *  be used with the subscript operator. Note that the key must be an integer, 
 *  and that a key error will be thrown if the key does not exist in the 
 *  dictionary. Instances of this class are used by the engine to make 
 *  lists of entities available to python. They cannot be created via script, 
 *  nor can they be modified.
 *
 *  Code Example:
 *  @{
 *  e = BigWorld.entities # this is a PyEntities object
 *  print "The entity with ID 100 is", e[ 100 ]
 *  print "There are", len( e ), "entities"
 *  @}
