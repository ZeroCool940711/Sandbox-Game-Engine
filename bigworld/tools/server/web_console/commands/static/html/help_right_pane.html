	<p>The <b>Commands</b> module provides the ability to execute scripts 
	from the <b>WebConsole</b> without needing to connect to a linux machine 
	and use developer / systems operator oriented tools.</p>

	<h2><a name="Commands">1. My commands</a></h2>

	<p>The <b>My Commands</b> page is designed to enable easy access to
	commonly used server functionality without requiring the user to
	have an in depth understanding of the server or lower level procedures.
	This enables common functions to be exposed for developers, game
	designers or even GM's.</p>

	<p>Any functions that are exposed on a CellApp or BaseApp either via a
	pyFunctionWatcher or a CallableWatcher will be displayed on this page.</p>

	<h3><a name="Usage">1.1. Usage</a></h3>
	<p>The <b>Command Library</b> table displays a list of available commands 
	through which scripts are executed.  Scripts that appear here are 
	generally commonly used functionality that is handy to expose for 
	developers, game designers or even GM's.</p>

	<p>When a script is selected a description of that script will be
	displayed, along with a list of arguments the script function
	accepts, and an <b>Execute</b> button.</p>

	<p>Depending on how the script is defined and its intended purpose, the
	script may be run on one or more components. For example the
	<code>systemMessage</code> script as shipped in FantasyDemo will be run
	on all BaseApps, whereas the <code>addGuards</code> script will
	only be run on one BaseApp (the least loaded). Where the script runs
	is a design decision for the person who implements the script as
	outlined in the <b>Server Programming Guide</b>.</p>

	<p>The <b>Return Value</b> component of the <b>My Commands</b> page
	will contain the value returned by the method called from each server
	component the script was run on. The output here should be prefixed by
	a component type and component number and is generally recommended to
	be a human readable string describing the result of the script call,
	however each script may return whatever they choose and return values
	should generally be outlined as part of the script description.</p>

	<p><b>Console Output</b> contains any stdout/stderr generated by the
	script call. In the case where multiple components generate output this
	will be output concatenated by component. The most likely occasion when
	output here will be of interest is in the case where a script generates
	an exception which needs to be debugged.</p>
