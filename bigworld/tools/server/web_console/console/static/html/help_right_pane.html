	<p>The <b>Python Console</b> module provides the ability to access Python
	functionality (and even exposed C++ methods) from the <b>WebConsole</b> 
	without needing to connect to a linux machine and use developer / systems 
	operator oriented tools.</p>


	<h2><a name="pyConsole">1. Python console</a></h2>
	<p>The <b>Python Console</b> page provides a simple web interface to the
	Python telnet port of BaseApps and CellApps. Using the Python console,
	users can interactively call script commands on a server process, or
	inspect the state of the server.</p>
	
	<p>Previously, developers would have to use <code>`control_cluster.py
	pyconsole`</code>, or run telnet from the command line to access this
	functionality.</p>

	<h3><a name="Usage">1.1. Usage</a></h3> 
	<p>Opening the <b>Python Console</b> page presents the user with a list
	of active server components owned by the current user that have an exposed
	Python console.</p>

	<p>Each process has a <b>Connect</b> link which links to a terminal
	like page that is connected to the associated server component. The
	console page can also be accessed via the <b>Cluster Control</b> module's
	<b>Manage Servers</b> page, and in the process <b>Action</b>
	drop-down list box selecting <b>Console</b> entry.</p>

	<p>The Python console page is designed to be similar to an interactive
	command line python console that most python developers should have
	encountered.</p>
