	A replacement for turbogears.expose() that does automatic status pass-back
	to the client browser so AJAX errors can be detected there as well as in the
	web console logs.

	All the app level code needs to know is that it can pass back JSON by
	returning a dictionary, it can cause a info dialog to be displayed in the
	client browser by returning a string, or it can cause an error dialog to be
	displayed by raising an Error (see below).  Uncaught exceptions in the app
	code will cause a stack trace to be displayed in a new window on the client.

	Note that this mechanism reserves several names in the returned dictionary,
	all of which start with an underscore.  Any app-level code that uses this
	should avoid passing back parameters that start with an underscore.
