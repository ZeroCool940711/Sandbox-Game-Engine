	<div class="help">

	<p>The <b>Cluster Control</b> module provides a simple interface to most of
	the functionality provided by the command-line server tools, such as
	<code>control_cluster.py</code>, <code>bot_op.py</code>, 
	and so on.</p>
		
	<p>It allows users to perform common tasks associated with running servers,
	such as:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Starting and stopping the server</li>
		<li>Inspecting the status of machines and server processes as they are
		running</li>
		<li>Determining which other users are running servers on the same
		machines as you</li>
	</ul>

    <h2><a name="ManagingServers">1. Managing servers</a></h2>

	<p>The <b>Cluster Control</b> module's home page is the <b>Manage
	Servers</b> page.</p> 

	<p>When the server is running, the page displays information about the
	server processes, and provides links to start more processes,
	restart or stop the server, save the server layout for future startups, 
	and view server logs.  When the server is not running, a link to 
	start it is displayed.</p>

	<p>Each process also has an attached <b>Actions</b> menu.
	This is a context-sensitive list of capabilities for each process, similar
	to the right-click context menu that a standalone
	application would display for a particular item or object.</p>

	<p>For most server processes, the actions are simply stopping, killing 
	and restarting the process, and viewing the logs for it. CellApps and 
	BaseApps have two additional links to connect to the process's interactive 
	Python server and to reload Python modules related to entities and custom 
	data types for the selected process.</p>

	<p>This is the ideal place for customers or third parties to provide their
	own capabilities and extensions.  Starting points for implementing
	extra capabilities are:</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li><code>bigworld/tools/server/web_console/common/caps.py</code></li>
		<li>The <code>Exposed</code> class in
		<code>bigworld/tools/server/pycommon/cluster.py</code></li>
	</ul>

    <h3><a name="StartingTheServer">1.1. Starting the server</a></h3>

	<p>Following the <b>Start the server</b> link from the <b>Manage
	Servers</b> page causes <b>WebConsole</b> to display the server's
	environment settings, and provides options as to which machines the server
	components will be started on.</p>

	<p>The <b>Server Environment</b> table at the top of the page displays
	information about the user you will be starting the server as. In
	particular, it displays the BigWorld environment settings that will be
	provided to each server process at startup (<code>MF_ROOT</code> and
	<code>BW_RES_PATH</code>). These values are read from the file
	<code>~/.bwmachined.conf</code> in the user's home directory, and if an
	inconsistency in these values is detected between the various machines
	being used to start processes, an error will be raised.</p>

	<p>The <b>Start</b> table provides different ways to select which machines
	will be used to run the server processes. The simplest method is starting
	all processes on a single machine. Alternatively, users can select to start
	the processes on a particular group of machines. Machine groupings are
	defined in the file <code>/etc/bwmachined.conf</code>. The group menu also
	includes an option to start server processes on all machines in the
	cluster.</p>

    <p>Users can also opt to start server processes on machines as specified
    in a pre-defined layout. At present, these layouts can only be generated
    by saving the layout of a running server, using the <b>Save this server
    layout</b> link in the <b>Manage Servers</b> page.</p>
	
	<p>If you would like the ability to hand-craft these layouts, please see
	the <code>save</code> and <code>load</code> commands supported by
	<code>control_cluster.py</code>, and examine the XML file format supported
	by those commands.</p>

	<p>As the server starts up, a table will be displayed indicating how many
	processes of each type are <b>dead</b> (i.e. process isn't running),
	<b>running</b> (process exists but hasn't registered with bwmachined yet)
	and <b>registered</b> (running and registered with bwmachined).  If at any
	point bwmachined fails to reply with info about a particular process, that
	process's counters will be replaced with question marks (?) until bwmachined
	replies with proper information.</p>

    <h3><a name="RestartingTheServer">1.2. Restarting The Server</a></h3>

    <p>Restarting the server via the <b>WebConsole</b> behaves identically to
    <code>`cluster_control.py restart`</code>, i.e. it will try to
    restart the server in the currently running layout, however if the current
    layout is missing any basic server processes (e.g. all CellApps have died
    for some reason), they will be automatically included in the layout before
    restarting.</p>

    <h2><a name="BrowsingMachines">2. Browsing machines</a></h2>

	<p>The <b>All Machines</b> page displays information about all machines on
	the network that are currently running <code>bwmachined</code>. Various
	runtime and hardware diagnostics are displayed for each machine.
	Clicking a machine brings a list of all processes running on it (under any
	UID).</p>

    <h2><a name="BrowsingUsers">3. Browsing users</a></h2>

	<p>The <b>All Users</b> page displays lists of both active (running at
	least one process that registers with <code>bwmachined</code>) and inactive
	(not running any processes that register with <code>bwmachined</code>)
	users.  Clicking a user takes you to the <b>Manage Servers</b> page for
	that user, which is a handy way to administer servers under UID's other 
	than your own.</p>

	<p>At the bottom of the Users page is a link <b>Refresh User List</b>,
	which causes all bwmachined's on the network to drop and then reload
	their user mapping. This may be needed in the situation where a new user
	has placed a .bwmachined.conf file in their home directory but has not
	been detected by any bwmachined process.</p>

    <h2><a name="BrowsingWatcherValues">4. Browsing watcher values</a></h2>

	<p>Watcher values are internal parameters of a running BigWorld server
	process that are explicitly exposed via the Watcher interface. Basically,
	watcher values allow users and applications to inspect their internal
	state.</p>

	<p>Watcher values are organised hierarchically into a tree structure. You
	can browse to the root of a process's watcher tree by clicking its name
	anywhere in the <b>Cluster Control</b> module. The two main places where
	these links are available are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The Process list on the <b>Manage Servers</b> page</li>
		<li>The Process list of a particular machine (see section <a
		href="#BrowsingMachines">Browsing Machines</a> above)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>When browsing watcher values, each page displays the values and
	subdirectories for a particular Watcher directory. Some watcher values are
	readable and writeable, and some are read-only (information about the write
	permissions is not currently part of the network protocol that the Python
	tools use to connect to the server processes).</p>
	
	<p>The <b>Advanced Options</b> check box at the bottom of the watcher 
	values page will reveal the <b>Actions</b> menu for each watcher if it 
	is selected. A writeable watcher value can be modified by selecting 
	the <b>Edit</b> menu item in the <b>Actions</b> menu of the watcher and 
	entering a new value on the ensuing page. Doing this for values with
	read-only access will have no effect.</p>

	<p>For further details on watchers, see the <b>Server Programming
	Guide</b>, chapter <b>The Watcher Interface</b>.</p>

    <h2><a name="SeeAlso">5. See also</a></h2>

	<p>Most or all of the functionality provided by the <b>Cluster Control</b>
	module is also provided by the <code>control_cluster.py</code> shell
	utility.  It also provides a number of other commands that are not
	supported by the <b>WebConsole</b> interface.</p>

	<p>For a complete list of available commands, use the <code>--help</code>
	switch.</p>

    <h2><a name="Caveats">6. Caveats</a></h2>

	<p>None of the Bots functionality provided by <code>bot_op.py</code> has
	been integrated into the web interface. All management of bots must still
	be done via the console.</p>
