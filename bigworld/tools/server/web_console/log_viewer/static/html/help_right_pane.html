	<p>The <b>Log Viewer</b> module provides an interface to the server message
	logs. It can be used to perform static searches through log data, as well
	as provide live views of log activity. Summaries of per-user log size and
	other information can also be generated.</p>

	<p>This module replaces the CGI script <code>bw_log_viewer.cgi</code> from
	BigWorld Technology version 1.7 and earlier.</p>

	<h2><a name="DisplayingOutput">1. Displaying output</a></h2>

	<p>If you just want to start using the tools and see some server output,
	click the <b>Live Output</b> link in the left-hand side navigation menu
	(this assumes you are currently running a server). The output from the
	server will be continuously updated in the log window.</p>

	<p>The default filter settings on the <b>Search</b> page will also give you
	the log output for the currently running server. Just click the <b>Fetch</b>
	button to run the query.</p>

	<h2><a name="Searching">2. Searching</a></h2>

	<p>Most of the functionality of the <b>Log Viewer</b> module is provided by
	the <b>Search</b> page. It provides a set of filters with which users can
	restrict the log results to be displayed, as well as check boxes that
	control the format of the output. All settings can be saved and restored
	to repeat common searches at a later time.</p>

	<p>Log results can be displayed as static searches or as continuously
	updated live output, using the <b>Fetch</b> and <b>Live Output</b> buttons,
	respectively.</p>

	<h3><a name="LogFilters">2.1. Log filters</a></h3>

	<p>The table of filters at the top of the page allows the user to restrict
	the kinds of log results that will be returned by a query. Fields that are
	regular-text entry widgets, if left blank, will not be used to filter
	results.</p>

	<p>Where appropriate, filters have a <b>Show</b> check box that controls
	whether that field will be displayed in the log output. A filter can still
	be used for filtering out results, even if it is not displayed.</p>

	<p>The following filters are available:</p>

	<table class="alternate" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
	<tr>	<th class="FirstCol">Filter</th>
			<th>Description</th>
	</tr>

	<tr><td class="oddRow1stCol">Time</td>
	<td class="oddRow">Time range over which the logs will be searched.  The
	time range is defined in a point-offset manner &ndash; the <b>Time</b>
	control is used to enter the time the user is interested in, and the
	<b>Period</b> is used to designate the period and direction the log should
	be searched in, relative to the nominated time.
	
	<p>Time can be entered as either a literal time, or as one of a set of
	supported meta-times.</p>
	
	<p>If it is entered literally, then it must follow the exact datetime
	format that is seen in the log output (<i>e.g.</i>, <code>"Mon 09 Oct 2006
	17:18:11.217"</code> &ndash; the milliseconds at the end are optional,
	everything else is mandatory).</p>
	 
	<p>Clicking the small calendar icon on the right displays a calendar widget
	that can be used to easily enter times in the correct format.</p>

	<p>All supported meta-times can be selected by clicking the images to the
	right of the text entry field. Currently supported meta-times are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>the beginning of the log</li>
		<li>the time of the last server startup</li>
		<li>the time of the last occurrence of a particular message</li>
		<li>present time</li>
	</ul>
	
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="evnRow1stCol">Period</td>
	<td class="evnRow">Period is defined by both a magnitude and direction
	&ndash; the first two fields are used to enter a multiple of common time
	units (seconds, minutes, hours, or days) and the third field is used to
	indicate the direction (forwards, backwards, either side, to beginning,
	or to present).
	
	<p>When <b>to beginning</b> or <b>to present</b> is selected, the first two
	fields are disregarded.</p>
	
	<p><b>NOTE</b>: If there are too many log results to display at once, they
	will be split onto multiple pages, much like a Google search. The results
	on each page are always displayed in chronological order (earliest results
	at the top), however, the ordering of the pages is determined by the
	direction of the search:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>When <b>Period</b> is <b>forwards</b>, <b>either side</b>, or <b>to
		present</b>, then result pages are returned in chronological
		order.</li>
		<li>When <b>Period</b> is <b>backwards</b> or <b>to beginning</b>, then
		result pages are returned in reverse order (most recent result page
		first).</li>
	</ul>
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="oddRow1stCol">Machine</td>
	<td class="oddRow">Log results can be displayed for all machines, or for a
	single machine.

	<p>Currently, it is not possible to filter based on a substring of the
	hostname or a netmask.</p>
	
	<p>Note that only machines that have sent at least one log message will
	appear in the filter list; not all machines running <code>bwmachined</code>
	will necessarily appear.</p>
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="evnRow1stCol">Username</td>
	<td class="evnRow">Log results are displayed for only one user at a time.
	As with the list of machines, only users who have sent at least one log
	message will appear in this list.
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="oddRow1stCol">PID</td>
	<td class="oddRow">Standard UNIX PID assigned by the operating system.
	</td></tr>


	<tr><td class="evnRow1stCol">AppID</td>
	<td class="evnRow">Incremental counter assigned by some of the server
	"manager" components to the processes they manage (<i>e.g.</i>,
	<code>cellapp01</code>, <code>baseapp02</code>, etc...).
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="oddRow1stCol">Process</td>
	<td class="oddRow">Processes to be displayed.
	
	<p>More than one selection can be made, by using <code>Shift</code> or
	<code>Ctrl</code>, or by drag selecting.</p>
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="evnRow1stCol">Severity</td>
	<td class="evnRow">Log levels to be displayed.
	
	<p>More than one selection can be made, by using <code>Shift</code> or
	<code>Ctrl</code>, or by drag selecting.</p>
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td class="oddRow1stCol">Message</td>
	<td class="oddRow">
		Text to <i>pattern match</i> against the log message itself.  Two text
		fields are provided to allow the user to specify both inclusion and
		exclusion patterns.
	
	<p>This filter has three independent options:</p>
	
	<table class="alternate" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th class="FirstCol">Option</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		
		<tr><td class="oddRow1stCol">Case-Sensitive</td>
		<td class="oddRow">Toggles case-sensitive pattern matching.
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td class="evnRow1stCol">Regex Match</td>
		<td class="evnRow">Toggles use of regular expressions (for details on
		regular expressions, see <code>`man 7 regex`</code>).
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td class="oddRow1stCol">Pre-Interpolate</td>
		<td class="oddRow">Controls whether format strings (<i>i.e.</i>,
		<code>%s</code>, <code>%d</code>, etc...) are interpolated before or
		after the filter stage of the query.

		<p>If you are not familiar with format strings or
		<code>printf()</code>, then you should leave this option checked.  When
		checked, all log entries have their format strings interpolated
		<b>before</b> filtering takes place.</p>

		<p>For example, if a server component calls <code>INFO_MSG( "Foo %d",
		12 )</code> and interpolate is <b>on</b>, then a search for the string
		<code>'12'</code> will be successful.  If interpolate is <b>off</b>,
		then the same search would not match that particular entry.</p>
		
		<p>Turning interpolate off results in faster queries, but may omit some
		wanted search results if you do not understand this mechanism.</p>
		
		<p>Also, be aware that messages with severity <code>SCRIPT</code> and
		higher are stored as <code>"%s"</code>, so you will not be able to
		match against any text from these messages unless pre-interpolate is
		switched <b>on</b>.</p>

	<h3><a name="QueryModes">2.2. Query modes</a></h3>

	<p>The <b>Log Viewer</b> module supports running queries in either
	<b>static</b> or <b>live</b> mode:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A static query (triggered with the <b>Fetch</b> button) will not
		update with new results that might become available after its execution.
		
		<p>There is a hard-coded limit to the number of results (10000 lines)
		that can be returned at one time; results may be paged through if more
		than this amount is returned from the query.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>Live queries continuously update as new entries are written to the
		logs, much like calling <code>`tail -f`</code> on a log file.
		
		<p>The <b>Time</b> and <b>Period</b> controls are ignored in live mode
		&ndash; when live mode is activated, the last 20 lines of output from
		the last hour are immediately displayed, and then new results are
		displayed as they are written to the logs.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<h3><a name="LinesOfContext">2.3. Lines of context</a></h3>

	<p>Lines of context around matching results can be displayed.  This works in
	exactly the same way as <code>`grep -C`</code>, and separates chunks of
	contiguous context with a <code>--</code> line.
	</p>

	<h3><a name="SavedFilterSettings">2.4. Saved filter settings</a></h3>

	<p>The <b>Action</b> drop-down list box located at the bottom
	right of the <b>Log Filters</b> table is used for saving, restoring, and
	deleting filter settings.</p>
	
	<p>This is useful for saving common searches, and the default filter
	settings can be set here too.</p>

	<p>The <b>Action</b> drop-down list box also allows users to manually 
	send a message to the log.  The message will be logged as sent from 
	the Tools process.

	<h3><a name="ConservingScreenRealEstate">2.5. Conserving screen real estate</a></h3>

	<p>The <b>Log Filters</b> table can be <i>rolled-up</i> by clicking the
	<b>up arrow</b> icon in the top right corner &ndash; this is especially
	useful on smaller displays.</p>
	
	<p>If the <b>Auto-Hide Settings</b> check box at the bottom of the table is
	checked, then the table automatically hides itself when either the
	<b>Fetch</b> or <b>Live Output</b> button is clicked.</p>

	<h2><a name="LiveOutputPage">3. Live Output page</a></h2>

	<p>The <b>Live Output</b> page is a simplified version of the search page
	running a live output query, with no filters applied, and with the log
	output for the currently logged in user continuously displayed.</p>

	<h2><a name="UsageSummaryPage">4. Usage Summary page</a></h2>

	<p>The <b>Usage Summary</b> page provides an overview of the size and
	period of each user's log.</p>
		
	<p>Clicking a particular username takes you to a page displaying detailed
	statistics on each segment of that user's log.</p>

	<h2><a name="SeeAlso">5. See also</a></h2>

	<p>The <code>bigworld/tools/server/message_logger</code> folder contains
	(amongst other things) a collection of utilities that allow you to work
	with message logs stored on a locally-accessible file system in a similar
	manner to standard UNIX shell utilities.</p>
