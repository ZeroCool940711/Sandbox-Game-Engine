		'threadPriority' acceptable values are:
			-1: loading thread priority low (app more responsive)
			 0: loading thread priority normal (faster Asset Browser, app still
				responsive)
			 1: loading thread priority high (fastest speed, app not very
				responsive)
		When using thread priority 1, the loading thread might get too much
		priority, making the application too unresponsive. To make the app more
		responsive while keeping the Asset Browser fast, use priority 1 and set
		the threadYieldMsec to somewhere between 20 to 250 (making the loading
		thread yield time to the main thread every threadYieldMsec milliseconds)
		'threadYieldMsec' should be a positive number. The higher it is, the
		faster the Asset Browser finds files and the less responsive the app
		will be. -->
