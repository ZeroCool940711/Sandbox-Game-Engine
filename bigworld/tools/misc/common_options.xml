		<!-- Mode can be AUTO, ON or OFF:
		- AUTO: Is recommended and default, and ensures the BigWorld tools release
		  their video memory when an application in the <apps> list below is running
		  and the application is in the background.
		- ON: Always releases DX resources when in the background to allow maximum
		  compatibility with other apps, but makes switching between apps slow.
		- OFF: Never releases its DX resources, making application switching fast,
		  but can result in crashes when running multiple DX applications.
