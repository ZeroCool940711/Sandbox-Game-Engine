<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2><a name="Overview">1. Overview</a></h2>

<p>A suite of utilities collectively referred to as &quot;server tools&quot; is
provided to monitor and query BigWorld servers' status, both live and post
event. These tools include WebConsole, MessageLogger and StatLogger.</p>

<p>This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a working
monitoring machine within a BigWorld server cluster. Note that it is also
possible for any user to run these tools without running them as a daemon.
For details on these tools, see the document <b>Server Operations Guide</b>.</p>

<p>For information on installing the BigWorld Server, see the
<a href="server_installation_guide.html">Server Installation Guide</a>.
</p>



<!-- RECOMMENDED SETUP -->
<h2><a name="RecSetup">2. Recommended Setup</a></h2>

<p>The recommended system configuration for the server tools is a single
machine within the server cluster that does not run any server processes such
as BaseAppMgr, CellAppMgr, and DBMgr. This machine will run the server tools
components StatLogger, MessageLogger, WebConsole, as well as BWMachined and
MySQL.</p>

<p>The isolation of the server tools on a separate machine is recommended in
order to ensure that if high load situations occur on any cluster machines, the
associated increase in logging and monitoring tasks performed by the server
tools do not further degrade performance on any of the active cluster
machines.</p>

<p>Due to the potential for log files to grow quite drastically in both a
development and a production environment it is recommended that, when creating
partitions for the installation, to create a seperate partition or have an
entirely seperate hard disk dedicated for the BigWorld server logs.</p>

<!-- REQUIREMENTS -->
<h2><a name="Reqs">3. Requirements &amp; Caveats</a></h2>

<h3><a name="HWReqs">3.1. Hardware requirements</a></h3>

<p>As a minimum, we recommend the following hardware system requirements:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul>
<li><p>1GHz CPU</li>
<li><p>1GB RAM</li>
<li><p>30GB Hard disk (for main OS install)</li>
<li><p>120GB Hard disk (for logging)</li>
<li><p>100Mbit NIC</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If an external machine is hosting the MySQL server for use with WebConsole
and StatLogger, we recommend that machine to have similar specifications. We
also recommend that the network link between the machine hosting the WebConsole
and/or StatLogger and the link to the MySQL server be low-latency and high
capacity for best performance.</p>

<h3><a name="ReqOther">3.2. Other requirements</a></h3>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul>
<li><p>Dedicated user account for the server tools</li>
<li><p>MySQL Database</li>
<li><p>Python 2.4 or higher</li>
<li><p>TurboGears v1.x</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="Dependencies">3.3. Dependencies</a></h3>

<p>WebConsole uses a MySQL database server for managing all
persistent data (such as user information, preferences, etc.). </p>

<p>For WebConsole, because of the way in which the MySQL
connection is managed by CherryPy (the underlying web framework), we require
that the MySQL version be at least 5.0 or later. This is so that the
<code>MYSQL_OPT_RECONNECT</code> option can be used to maintain the connection
between WebConsole and the MySQL database server. </p>

<p>This version of MySQL is available by default with Fedora Core 7+ and
Debian Etch.</p>

<p>The statistics collecting process, StatLogger also relies on a MySQL
database server for storing process and machine statistics, though this
can potentially be different to the database server used by WebConsole.</p>

<h3><a name="Caveats">3.4. Caveats</a></h3>

<p>Known issues with the server tools generally arise on a per distribution
basis and are outlined as such below.</p>

<h4><a name="CaveatsRHEL5">3.4.1. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5</a></h4>

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul>
<li><p>Spaceviewer does not work due to no wxPython package. wxPython can
be compiled from source, however BigWorld will not be able to provide
assistance in this nor will we be able to provide support for any issues
encountered from a self-compiled version of wxPython.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4><a name="CaveatsSarge">3.4.2. Debian 3.x - Sarge</a></h4>
<p>
<b>Unsupported.</b> The server tools are not supported on Debian Sarge due
to the age of available packages. If your working cluster environment
requires Debian, we recommend an installation of Debian Etch for the
server tools machine instead.</p>

<h4><a name="CaveatsCentOSRHEL">3.4.3. CentOS / RHEL</a></h4>
<p>
<b>Unsupported.</b> The server tools are currently not supported on CentOS/RHEL.
However, this status may change in the future.</p>

<!-- POST INSTALLATION SETUP -->
<h2><a name="PostSetup">4. Post-installation Setup</a></h2>

<p>The 1.9 server tools have been tested to work against Fedora Core releases
7 and 8 as well as Debian Stable (Etch), however the installation procedure
varies slightly due to the availability of packages on some releases. For
information on installing Fedora 8, refer to the
<a href="./server_installation_guide.html#InstallFC">
Server Installation Guide</a>. Make sure you install the MySQL server when
prompted.</p>


<h3><a name="PostSetupPkgUpdate">4.1. Update System Packages</a></h3>

<p>After any system installation it is a good idea to update all the installed
system packages as there may have been important security fixes or other bug
fixes which can impact the performance and security of your system since the
installation media used for your install was produced.</p>

<h4><a name="PostSetupPkgUpdateFedora">4.1.1. Fedora</a></h4>

<p>As root:</p>
<pre># yum update</pre>

<p>After performing this update it is a good idea to reboot your computer to
pick up any system changes.</p>

<h4><a name="PostSetupPkgUpdateDebian">4.1.2. Debian</a></h4>

<p>As root:</p>
<pre>
# apt-get update
# apt-get upgrade
</pre>

<p>After performing this update it is a good idea to reboot your computer to
pick up any system changes.</p>



<h3><a name="PostSetupUser">4.2. Create user account</a></h3>

<p>The server tools require their own user account to run as. This is done to
help isolation of processes and files. It is also suggested to create a unique
group which all server tool components and logs will be owned as. To create a
user and group on the current system we will use the <code>useradd</code> and
<code>groupadd</code> commands.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this installation guide, we will use a username and
groupname of <code>bwtools</code>, however these can be whatever you
prefer for your own environment.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If your environment uses an LDAP or NIS user account
infrastructure, you will have to follow your own environment's account and
group creation procedures.</p>

<p>Perform the following operations as root.</p>

<p>Create the group:</p>
<pre>
# /usr/sbin/groupadd bwtools
</pre>

<p>Create the user account:</p>
<pre>
# /usr/sbin/useradd bwtools -g bwtools -d /home/bwtools -m
</pre>

<p>Set the password of the user account:</p>
<pre>
# passwd bwtools
Changing password for user bwtools.
New UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
</pre>

<h3><a name="PostSetupPkgs">4.3. Other packages</a></h3>

<p>Some packages not necessarily installed by default are required during the
installation procedure. Please ensure you install the following packages
for your distribution.</p>

<h4><a name="PostSetupPkgsFedora">4.3.1. Fedora Core 7 / 8</a></h4>

<p>As root run:</p>
<pre># yum install python-setuptools MySQL-python</pre>

<h4><a name="PostSetupPkgsFedora8">4.3.2. Fedora Core 8 (only)</a></h4>

<p>Please ensure you have already installed the packages listed above in the
<a href="#PostSetupPkgsFedora">Fedora Core 7 / 8</a> section.</p>

<p>As root run:</p>
<pre># yum install python-setuptools-devel</pre>


<h4><a name="PostSetupPkgsDebianEtch">4.3.3. Debian Stable (Etch)</a></h4>

<p>As root run:</p>
<pre>
# apt-get update
# apt-get install gcc g++ libmysqlclient15-dev unzip make python python-dev python-setuptools python-mysqldb
</pre>

<p>It is also necessary to install two additional Python modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <i>uuid</i> module</li>
<li>the <i>fpconst</i> module</li>
</ul>

<p>Install these using python-setuptools installed above:</p>

<pre>$ cd mf/bigworld/tools/server/pycommon/redist
$ easy_install-2.4 -zmaxd . uuid
$ easy_install-2.4 -zmaxd . fpconst</pre>


<h3><a name="PostSetupMySQL">4.4. MySQL server</a></h3>

<p>After installation it is quite common to not have the MySQL server active
or setup to restart after a reboot. As it is a core component of the server
tools, it is important to check the MySQL server is setup correctly before
proceding.</p>

<h4><a name="PostSetupMySQLFedora">4.4.1. Fedora</a></h4>

<p>As root run:</p>
<pre>
# /sbin/chkconfig --levels 345 mysqld on
# /etc/init.d/mysqld start
</pre>


<!--
<h3><a name="PostSetupFC6Hosts">3.5. Fedora Core 6 Quirks</a></h3>

<p>A common issue encountered with fresh installations of Fedora Core 6, find
that there is no IPv4 entry for <code>localhost</code> in the file
<code>/etc/hosts</code>. Please ensure that your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file
has the following line:
<pre>127.0.0.1   localhost.localdomain   localhost</pre></p>
-->




<!-- OBTAIN SOURCE CODE -->
<h2><a name="ToolsSource">5. Checkout/unpack tools source</a></h2>

<p>The only directory required to run the server tools is
&quot;<code>bigworld/tools/server</code>&quot;. This directory should exist
within and be owned by the <code>bwtools</code> user account created above in
<a href="#PostSetupUser">Section 4.2. Create User Account</a>. It is
recommended to keep the same directory layout when creating this directory as
with all the other BigWorld software in the cluster.  We also assume that these
tools will be placed into the <code>/home/bwtools/mf</code> directory.</p>

<p>First, we need to log in as the <code>bwtools</code> user for installing
the files as that user.</p>

<pre>
login: bwtools
Password: ********
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
su - bwtools
</pre>

<p>Confirm you are in the <code>bwtools</code> home directory.</p>
<pre>
$ pwd
/home/bwtools
</pre>

<p>Confirm you are the <code>bwtools</code> user.</p>
<pre>
$ whoami
bwtools
</pre>

<p>Because the user will only be running the server tools, we only require a
minimal checkout of the respository. The server tools directory
<code>bigworld/tools/server</code> is the primary focus of what is required,
however due to a re-occuring issue with python connections to MySQL servers
we also require a redistributed version of MySQL-python
<code>bigworld/src/server/tools/redist</code> which contains a patch that
hasn't been applied upstream.</p>

<p>If you are working from SVN, you may wish to obtain the source similar to
this:</p>

<pre>
$ cd $HOME
$ svn co http://YOUR_REPOSITORY/bigworld/tools/server mf/bigworld/tools/server
$ svn co http://YOUR_REPOSITORY/bigworld/src/server/tools/redist mf/bigworld/src/server/tools/redist
</pre>




<!-- TURBOGEARS INSTALL -->
<h2><a name="TurboGearsInstall">6. Installing TurboGears</a></h2>

<p><b>Upgrading an old installation:</b> Please be aware that the following
instructions will not work if you are upgrading from an old TurboGears
installation. If you wish to upgrade from a 1.8.1 or prior version, please
see the section <a href="#Upgrading">Upgrading from a previous version</a>.


<h3><a name="TGInstallFedora">6.1. Fedora Core 7 / 8</a></h3>

<p>As root run:</p>
<pre># yum install TurboGears python-sqlobject</pre>

<h3><a name="TGInstallEtch">6.2. Debian Stable (Etch)</a></h3>

<p>As root run:</p>
<pre># apt-get install python-turbogears python-sqlobject</pre>


<!-- SERVER TOOLS SETUP -->
<h2><a name="ToolsSetup">7. Preparing to install server tools</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ToolsResPath">7.1. BWMachined</a></h3>

<p>Please see the instructions on
<a href="./server_installation_guide.html#InstallBWMachined">how to install
and configure BWMachined</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="ToolsMySQLUser">7.2. Database Account</a></h3>

<p>Depending on how intend to segment your database you may wish to create
a new database user at this point for the server tools to use. Use the
MySQL <code>GRANT</code> command to enable access for a new user to your
database. An example can be found in the
<a href="./server_installation_guide.html#ConfigureMySQLServer">
Server Installation Guide</a>.</p>


<!-- SERVER TOOLS INSTALLATION -->
<h2><a name="InstallScript">8. Server Tools Installation</a></h2>

<p>Before installing the server tools, make sure that MySQL is installed, and a
MySQL user has been added. For details on how to do this, see the document 
<a href="./server_installation_guide.html">Server Installation Guide</a>, section 
<a href="./server_installation_guide.html#ConfigureMySQLServer">Configure MySQL Server</a>.</p>

<p>The final step to installing the server tools is to run the script
<code>bigworld/tools/server/install/install_tools.py</code>. The purpose of the
<code>install_tools.py</code> script is to install system startup scripts into
<code>/etc/init.d</code>, and setup which run levels the new system services
should start in. Once this has been done, the installation script will attempt
to launch the services. This process will also attempt to verify the
environment in which the server tools have been installed in and create any
required directories.</p>

<p>The installation script must be run as root from the
<code>bigworld/tools/server/install</code> directory.</p>
<pre>
$ cd /home/bwtools/mf/bigworld/tools/server/install
$ su
# ./install_tools.py

BigWorld Server Tools Installation

NOTE: This installation program will not copy binaries into your
      system paths, the system startup scripts and configuration
      files are used to reference back into the current tools
      directory. If you intend on moving the tools you will need
      to re-run this script.
</pre>


<p>The first stage of the installation will ask you about your MySQL database.
Default settings have been provided, which should be correct for the hostname
and port if the recommended system setup is used. You may have to modify the
username and password fields depending on your desired MySQL configuration.
Once this information has been entered, the script will attempt to connect to
the database to verify its existence, and to create the necessary database for
WebConsole, and will then modify the configuration files for the
server tools that need to connect to the database.</p>

<pre>
* Database Configuration

Please input MySQL database information:
Hostname [localhost]: 
Port [3306]: 
Username [bigworld]: bwtools
Password [bigworld]: bwtools_passwd

MySQL database configuration:
Hostname : localhost
Port     : 3306
Username : bwtools
Password : btools_passwd

Are these details correct?
 [yes] 

+ Creating web_console database in MySQL
+ Writing '../web_console/prod.cfg'.
+ Writing '../stat_logger/preferences.xml'.
</pre>

<p>The next set of questions will verify that the environment that the tools
are installed in (and will be run from) is as expected. This is a last chance
for you to make any modifications to the environment before the server tools
are installed. The environment can be changed at any point. Doing so, however,
will require updating configuration files or re-running the installation
script.</p>

<pre>
* Server Tools Installation

Server tools will be run as:
User  : bwtools
Group : bwtools

Are these details correct?
 [yes] 


* Server Tools: Installation Paths

This installation is being run from under '/home/bwtools/mf/bigworld/tools/server'.
Configuration files and system startup scripts will be modified
to refer to this installation directory.

Is this directory correct?
 [yes] 
</pre>

<p>Next, we specify where MessageLogger is to store its logs.
This should be a location with enough room to cope with a large amount of
logs.</p>
<pre>
Where should message_logger store its logs?
 [/var/log/bigworld/message_logger] 
</pre>

<p>The server tools startup scripts will need a location to store
<code>.pid</code> files, which record the process ID  and running state of the
server tools. This is specified as below: </p>
<pre>
Where should .pid files be stored?
 [/var/run/bigworld] 
</pre>

<p>You are now given an opportunity to confirm the input directories and modify
them if necessary.</p>
<pre>
Server tools directories:
Tool dir : /home/bwtools/mf/bigworld/tools/server
Log dir  : /var/log/bigworld/message_logger
PID dir  : /var/run/bigworld


Are these details correct?
 [yes] 

+ Chown'ing '/var/log/bigworld' to bwtools:bwtools

+ Chown'ing '/var/run/bigworld' to bwtools:bwtools

+ Chown'ing '/var/log/bigworld/message_logger' to bwtools:bwtools

+ Chcon'ing '../message_logger/bwlog.so' type to user_u:object_r:textrel_shlib_t
</pre>

<p>The final step to install the server tools will attempt to copy the
<code>init.d</code> scripts for the 3 server tools into
<code>/etc/init.d</code> then start the services. The MySQL service should be
started before StatLogger and WebConsole, otherwise
they will fail to load.</p>

<pre>
* Installing system services
- Uninstalling existing system service 'bw_stat_logger'
+ Installing package: bw_stat_logger
Starting stat_logger:                                      [  OK  ]
- Uninstalling existing system service 'bw_message_logger'
+ Installing package: bw_message_logger
Starting message_logger:                                   [  OK  ]
- Uninstalling existing system service 'bw_web_console'
+ Installing package: bw_web_console
Starting BigWorld web console:                             [  OK  ]
</pre>

<!-- POST-INSTALLATION -->
<h2><a name="PostInstallConfig">9. Post-installation</a></h2>

<p>The server tools should now be completely installed and running on your new
machine. All that remains is a few final testing and configuration steps.</p>

<p>First, we will confirm that all services are running:</p>
<pre>
$ /etc/init.d/bw_stat_logger status
Status of stat_logger: running

$ /etc/init.d/bw_message_logger status
Status of message_logger: running

$ /etc/init.d/bw_web_console status
Status of web_console: running
</pre>

<p>Once we are sure the services are running, we can attempt to connect to the
WebConsole via HTTP. The web server is started on port 8080, so
connect to the WebConsole using a URL such as
<code>http://<i>hostname</i>:8080/</code>. You should be presented with the
page similar to the following:</p>

<div><img src="./web_console_login.png" alt="WebConsole login page"/></div>

<p>The user accounts on the WebConsole now need to be created and
the default administration login password changed. To do this, log in with
username <em>admin</em>, password <em>admin</em>. Please refer to the
<em>Server Operations Guide</em> for details.</p>



<!-- UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS -->
<h2><a name="Upgrading">10. Upgrading from a previous release</a></h2>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> BigWorld strongly urges users to perform a fresh install
when migrating from BigWorld 1.8.x releases to BigWorld 1.9.x. This is
due to the large changes between the releases and the underlying distribution
dependancies.</p>

<p>Please be aware that as with any software upgrade, changes may occur in
a manner you aren't expecting. We strongly urge a test period on a seperate
installation prior to migrating to the new release to ensure all
functionality works for your site prior to making the new release live.</p>

<p>There is currently no dedicated utility to assist with upgrading from
a previous release, and while a fresh installation will ensure the best
success installing the server tools, the following procedure should enable
a successful migration path from a previous release.</p>

<p>Please be aware as outlined in <a href="#CaveatsSarge">Section 2.4.1</a>,
Debian Sarge is no longer supported for the server tools. If your current
server tools installation resides on a Debian Sarge machine we recommend a
fresh installation of the server tools on a Debian Etch distribution.</p>


<h3><a name="UpgradingStopServices">10.1. Stop current services</a></h3>

<p>As root run:</p>
<pre>
# /etc/init.d/bw_web_console stop
Stopping BigWorld web_console:                             [  OK  ]

# /etc/init.d/bw_message_logger stop
Stopping message_logger:                                   [  OK  ]

# /etc/init.d/bw_stat_logger stop
Stopping stat_logger:                                      [  OK  ]
</pre>

<h3><a name="UpgradingBackupPref">10.2 Backup old release &amp; preferences</a></h3>

<p>As a safety measure it is recommended to keep a copy of your current
installation around in case you find you need to revert to it. It is
also recommended to backup your preference files to avoid performing
a re-installation with the install_tools.py script.</p>

<p>As the bwtools user:</p>
<pre>
$ mkdir $HOME/preferences_backup $HOME/preferences_backup/init.d
$ cd $HOME/mf/bigworld/tools/server
$ cp message_logger/message_logger.conf $HOME/preferences_backup
