<a name="detailed_description"></a><h2>Detailed Description</h2>
A <a href="PyClient.html">PyClient</a> is the device through which a real cell <a href="Entity.html">Entity</a> is able to call
methods on its client instances. A new <a href="PyClient.html">PyClient</a> object is created by
<a href="BigWorld.html">BigWorld</a> each time an entity's "client", "otherClients" or "allClients"
attributes are accessed, and each time an entity's "clientEntity" function
is called. Objects of this type cannot otherwise be created via script.
<br><br>
A <a href="PyClient.html">PyClient</a> can be used to send method calls to either the client which owns
the entity, all clients except the one which owns the entity, or all
clients. It can also be used to call methods on a different entity which is
owned by the same client. These options are set when the <a href="PyClient.html">PyClient</a> is
created, and cannot be altered afterwards via python. The <a href="PyClient.html">PyClient</a> objects
provided by the entity members client, otherClients, allClients and
clientEntity are each set up differently in these respects, as described in
the <a href="Entity.html">Entity</a> class documentation.
<br><br>
<a href="PyClient.html">PyClient</a> objects have no default attributes or methods, however <a href="BigWorld.html">BigWorld</a>
populates them with <a href="ClientCaller.html">ClientCaller</a> objects which represent the methods that
can be called. These are built using information provided in the entity
def files. A <a href="ClientCaller.html">ClientCaller</a> object can then be called as if it were the
method that it represents, which causes it to add a request to call the
appropriate function on the next bundles that are sent to the appropriate
clients.
<br><br>
Example:
<br><br>
If the .def file "myEntityClass.def" contained the following

<pre>    &lt;ClientMethods&gt;
        &lt;pointAt&gt;
            &lt;Arg&gt; OBJECT_ID &lt;/Arg&gt; &lt;!-- entity to point at --&gt;
        &lt;/pointAt&gt;
    &lt;/ClientMethods&gt;
</pre>
then where "myEntity" is an instance of "myEntityClass", the following
python code would be valid.

<pre># This example tells myEntity to point at the entity with ID #100, on a
# range of clients.

# the client which owns myEntity
myEntity.client.pointAt( 100 )

# all clients other than the one which owns myEntity
myEntity.otherClient.pointAt( 100 )

# all clients
myEntity.allClients.pointAt( 100 )
</pre>
