<a name="detailed_description"></a><h2>Detailed Description</h2>
A <a href="PyServer.html">PyServer</a> is the device through which an entity is able to call methods
on it's instance on a server. <a href="BigWorld.html">BigWorld</a> creates two <a href="PyServer.html">PyServer</a> objects
as attributes for each client entity, "cell" and "base", which can be
used to send method calls to the entity's cell and base instances,
respectively. These cannot be created in script.
<br><br>
<a href="PyServer.html">PyServer</a> objects have no default attributes or methods, however <a href="BigWorld.html">BigWorld</a>
populates them with <a href="ServerCaller.html">ServerCaller</a> objects which represent the methods that
can be called. These are built using information provided in the entity
def files. A <a href="ServerCaller.html">ServerCaller</a> object can then be called as if it were the
method that it represents, which causes it to add a request to call the
appropriate function on the next bundle that is sent to the server.
<br><br>
This is not supported for licensees who have not licensed the <a href="BigWorld.html">BigWorld</a>
server technology.
