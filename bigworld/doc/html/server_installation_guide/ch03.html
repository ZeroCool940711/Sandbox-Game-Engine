                 completely new to a BigWorld server setup and is working on a freshly
                 installed machine. As such we will step through some basic setup steps such
                 as creating a new user account for the developer to run a BigWorld server
                 with. Feel free to step over any steps you already feel confident

            <p>The following procedures will also assume that the operations will be
                 performed using a Linux console or terminal. While there are graphical
                 alternatives available for users that have chosen a GUI installation, by
                 describing the text based alternatives we are able to simplify the steps to
                 the core behaviour being performed.

                  <p>If you are working in a large office environment you may wish to
                           talk to your Systems Administrator about the user configuration
                           mechanism that is already in place in the office. The approach described
                           below may conflict with other distributed account mangement systems such
                           as LDAP or NIS.

               <p>Each developer that will need to run their own server must have a
                      Linux user account created for them. This is to enable them to have a
                      location that stores their individual development files and the
                      configuration files which determine how their server instance will be
                      started.

               <p>The following command which is run as the root user is used to

               <p>With the user directory created we now need to set a password for

                  <p>While we haven't discussed multiple computer installations in much
                           detail up to this point, one of the most common mistakes with user
                           accounts can occur when a user account is created on different machines
                           in the network with different numerical user IDs (UID). For example,
                           suppose we had two server machines <span class="literal">host-A</span> and
                           <span class="literal">host-B</span> and we performed the following
                           operations:
                  </p><pre class="programlisting"># On host-<em class="emphasis">A</em>
useradd alice
useradd bob

# On host-<em class="emphasis">B</em>
useradd bob
useradd alice</pre><p>Notice that the sequence of operations has been reversed on
                           <span class="literal">host-B</span> compared with what was performed on
                           <span class="literal">host-A</span>. As a result the UID that is created for the
                           user <span class="literal">bob</span> on <span class="literal">host-B</span> may be the same
                           as user <span class="literal">alice</span> on <span class="literal">host-A</span>. If the
                           UIDs conflict for two users, there will be issues with server management
                           and server monitoring.
                  </p>
                  <p>There are a number of alternatives you can use to resolve this
                           potential issue which will depend on how many machines you will need to
                           use in your network. The most simple approach is to specify a UID when
                           you create the accounts, such as:
                  </p><pre class="programlisting">$ useradd <em class="emphasis">-u <em class="replaceable"><code>6001</code></em></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em></pre><p>In this example the UID of 6001 was specified as the user was
                           created, which allows us to specify the same UID when we create the
                           account on another machine. This approach however becomes unfeasible
                           when dealing with a large number of machines, in which case we may look
                           to use a centralised account management solution such as LDAP or NIS.
                           These approaches are more complex and are out of the scope of this
                           document. There are numerous online resources that will guide you
                           through the process of setting up these account management
                           solutions.

                                   is automatically filled in with the BigWorld resource directory. The

                                   contains default configuration files and Python libraries that are
                                   used by the server processes.

                           strongly recommended to create your own keypair from the start of your
                           project and store it in your game resource directory rather than in the
                           BigWorld resource directory.

               <p>With a project created and with all the relevant configuration files
                      set, we can look to start our server. In order to interact with a BigWorld
                      server cluster we provide both a web interface and a set of command line
                      tools. For most server interacts we recommend using the web interface and
                      we will describe this approach here.
               </p>
               <p>The web interface to the BigWorld server is called WebConsole. It
                      provides a number of features for interacting with a BigWorld server
                      cluster that are more fully outlined in the <a href="../server_operations_guide/index.html" class="olink">Server Operations Guide</a>'s chapter <a href="../server_operations_guide/ch03.html" class="olink"><i>Cluster Administration Tools</i></a>.
               </p>
               <p>WebConsole is automatically started and runs on port 8080 of the
                      machine on which the <span class="literal">bigworld-tools</span> RPM was installed.
                      To connect to the WebConsole we would then use a URL such as
                      <span class="literal">http://<em class="replaceable"><code>hostname</code></em>:8080/</span>
                      replacing <em class="replaceable"><code>hostname</code></em> with either the IP address
                      of the machine or its hostname depending on how the other machines in your
                      network have been configured. To avoid confusion when testing WebConsole
                      for the first time we recommend using the IP address of the WebConsole
                      machine to confirm that any issues aren't related to hostname or DNS
                      resolution problems.
               </p>
               <p>When connecting for the first time you should be presented with a
                      screen similar to the following:
               </p>

               <p>The user accounts on the WebConsole now need to be created and the

                      username <span class="literal">admin</span>, password

               <p>The purpose of this page is to allow you to review both your
                      configuration settings and the machine (or machines) on which you would
                      like to start the server prior to launching the cluster. For our purposes
                      we will use the default settings which should launch the server on a
                      single machine, identified using either your hostname or the IP address of
                      your local machine. To start the server simply press the 'Go!' button. You
                      should now see an interim web page that automatically updates as each
                      server process starts:
               </p>
               <div class="informalfigure">
                  <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/web_console_server_starting.png" align="middle"></div>
               </div>
               <p>The above image shows us all the server processes except the BaseApp
                      and CellApp have started running and are operational. The BaseApp and
                      CellApp processes are the last to start as they rely on all the other
                      server processes to operate correctly.
               </p>
               <p>You should now have an active server instance which presents you
                      with a web page similar to the following:
               </p>
               <div class="informalfigure">
                  <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/web_console_server_running.png" align="middle"></div>
               </div>
               <p>At this point you should be ready to move on to the <a href="../bigworld_tutorial/index.html" class="olink">Tutorial</a> which will start to lead you through the
                      process of creating your own game and understanding the programming
                      concepts involved in interacting with BigWorld.
               </p>
               <p>Good luck with your development!</p>
