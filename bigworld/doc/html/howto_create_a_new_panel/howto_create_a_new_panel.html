  Editor, use a custom tear-off panel system developed by BigWorld. This
  system allows for easy creating of new panels from C++ which can then be
  docked, teared off and resized by the user. For more information, please see
  the <a href="../content_tools_reference_guide/content_tools_reference_guide#Content_Tools_Reference_Guide" class="olink">Content Tools Reference Guide</a>'s section <a href="../content_tools_reference_guide/content_tools_reference_guide#xref_Panel_System" class="olink"><i>Panel System</i></a>.</p></div><div class="chapter" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Sample Panel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="xref_Sample_Panel"></a>Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Sample Panel</h2></div></div></div><p>We have included a barebones panel template example in the World
  Editor Visual Studio project that can be used either in World Editor, Model
  Editor or Particle Editor. It is implemented in the file
  <code class="filename">src/tools/worldeditor/gui/pages/page_my_panel.cpp</code> and
  its corresponding header file. The code is well documented, and includes
  comments about how to convert that template into an actual panel in the
  tool.</p></div><div class="chapter" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Detailed Steps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="xref_Detailed_Steps"></a>Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Detailed Steps</h2></div></div></div><p>It is always best to start by looking at one of the other panels, or
  from the self-explanatory sample panel template described above, but it is
  also important to know the detailed steps involved in the process.</p><p>First, you start from either a <code class="classname">CDialog</code> or a
  <code class="classname">CFormView</code>. A <code class="classname">CDialog</code> is
  simpler and won't show scrollbars if the tab is resized too small.
  <code class="classname">CDialog</code> classes are great if you make your dialog's
  controls to expand / shrink with the panel. A <code class="classname">CDialog</code>
  based example would be <code class="classname">PageOptionsHistogram</code>, in
  <code class="filename">src/tools/bigbang/page_options_histogram.?pp</code>. A
  <code class="classname">CFormView</code> creates scrollbars as needed, so it's great
  for when you want to keep your controls the same size and position inside
  the dialog, and show scrollbars if the tab is smaller than a certain size.
  An example of this would be <code class="classname">PageOptionsWeather</code>, in
  <code class="filename">src/tools/bigbang/page_options_weather.?pp</code>. It is
  probably possible to inherit from other MFC classes, but those are the two
  we use.</p><p>Whatever MFC base class you use, you also need to inherit from
  <code class="classname">GUITABS::Content</code>, which is the base class that allows
  the <code class="classname">GUITABS</code> Manager to handle tab/panel
  docking/floating of your dialog. <code class="classname">GUITABS::Content</code> is
  pure virtual, but there are some macros that were written afterwards that
  implement all its methods with reasonable default implementations. These
  macros are defined in <code class="filename">src/lib/guitabs/content.hpp</code>, and
  are well documented there. For example,
  <code class="classname">PageOptionsWeather</code> uses the
  <span class="literal">IMPLEMENT_BASIC_CONTENT</span> macro at the beginning of the
  class' declaration.</p><p>You also need to declare a factory for your dialog. Again, some handy
  macros found in <code class="filename">src/lib/guitabs/content_factory.hpp</code>
  will be sufficient in most cases. Note that there's a special macro for
  <code class="classname">CDialog</code> derived panels, called
  <span class="literal">IMPLEMENT_CDIALOG_CONTENT_FACTORY</span>.</p><p>Once you have done all this, you are ready to go. All it's left is to
  register the factory, and to create a the panel manually in case a previous
  <code class="filename">layout.xml</code> file doesn't exist. Both these things are
  done in the <code class="classname">PanelManager</code> class, which for World
  Editor is in <code class="filename">src/tools/bigbang/panel_manager.?pp</code>. In
  the method <code class="methodname">PanelManager::initPanels</code>, the factories
  are registered. For example, the <code class="classname">PageOptionsWeather</code>
  factory is registered like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">GUITABS::Manager::instance()-&gt;registerFactory(
       new PageOptionsWeatherFactory() );</pre><p>You must also manually insert the panel inside
  <span class="literal">PanelManager::loadDefaultPanels</span> like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">p = GUITABS::Manager::instance()-&gt;insertPanel(
       PageOptionsWeather::contentID, GUITABS::TAB, p );</pre><p>Last, there's a map that we build manually to keep track of the panels
  currently supported in the tool. This is handy for when a new panel is
  added, the tool will detect that it's missing in the
  <code class="filename">layout.xml</code> file, and will reload the default panel
  layout which should bring up the new panel (because you add it there with
  <code class="methodname">insertPanel()</code> as described above). This is done in
  the <code class="classname">PanelManager</code> constructor, so simply add your
  panel there. Particle Editor has its own way of checking for missing dialogs
  as well, in <code class="methodname">PanelManager::finishLoad()</code>.</p><p>Once you do all this, the tool will take care of all the docking /
  floating of your panel, plus it will save your last panel layout to disk or
  load the default layout when it needs to (i.e. the user requests it by
  clicking on the appropriate menu item).</p></div></div></div></body></html>
