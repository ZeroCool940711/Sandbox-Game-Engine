            <p>Mailboxes to entities residing on a BaseApp should exist for as long
               as they are needed by the web server. However, these same entities may be
               player entities controlled by the BigWorld client. These two different
               usages of the same entity must be reconciled when it comes to managing
               entity lifetimes &#8212; for example, if the client disconnects while the
               game's web interface is still using the player's base entity, this entity
               should not be destructed until the game's web interface has finished with
               it. Also, if the player is currently not logged in via the BigWorld client.
                 If the player does not explicitly log out of the web server, we would want
                 to clean up that mailbox reference after an inactivity period.
            </p>
            <p>The solution to this problem is for the <span class="literal">TwistedWeb</span>
                 service to periodically inform the base entity that it is still interested
                 in it. The entity can then stay around even if the client has disconnected
                 (destruction of the base entity is the normal course of action).
            </p>
            <p>The <span class="literal">TwistedWeb</span> service keeps a cache of mailboxes.
                 Only mailboxes to entities that have a
                 <code class="methodname">webKeepAlivePing()</code> method are cached. Each time the
                 service is queried that uses one of these mailboxes it is either added to
                 this cache or marked with the time it was last queried.
            </p>
            <p>The service will periodically check all mailboxes in this cache. If
                 the mailbox has not been used for a long time, it is removed from the cache.
                 If it is still active, the <code class="methodname">webKeepAlivePing()</code>
                 method is called on it.
            </p>
            <p>It is okay if the mailbox is removed from the cache too early. In this
                 case, the database will be queried to retrieve the mailbox. This is
                 important when running multiple <code class="code">TwistedWeb</code> service fragments on
                 different ServiceApps. Besides a very minor performance impact on the
                 database, it does not matter which ServiceApp is queried. Running the
                 service on multiple ServiceApps is a way to achieve fault tolerance and also
                 scaling beyond a single machine.
            </p>
            <p>This functionality is implemented in
                 <code class="filename">bigworld/res/scripts/service/TWResources/KeepAliveMailboxes.py</code>.
                 The frequency of the pings is specified by the
                 <code class="varname">CHECK_PERIOD</code> constant. The amount of time before a
                 mailbox times out is specified by the <code class="varname">TIMEOUT_PERIOD</code>
                 constant.
            </p>
            <p>For game script, entities can make use of the
                 <code class="classname">KeepAlive</code> class located in
                 <code class="filename">fantasydemo/res/scripts/base/KeepAlive.py</code> to implement
                 this functionality. It also has <code class="varname">CHECK_PERIOD</code> and
                 <code class="varname">TIMEOUT_PERIOD</code> constants specifying how frequently to
                 check for these entities timing out and how long before they time out. This
                 timeout period should be slightly more than that of
                 <code class="filename">KeepAliveMailboxes.py</code>.
            </p>
            <p>When accessing this service from a website, keep-alive intervals can
                 be used with HTTP session timeouts so that players have to re-login after a
                 certain inactivity period to create a new HTTP session. Keep-alive intervals
                 should be set to be equal to or longer than session durations.
