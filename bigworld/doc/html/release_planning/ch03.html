            <p>Developing and deploying an MMOG is a complicated task. Developers
                 using BigWorld Technology need to be aware of many issues to help avoid
                 problems when deploying their game. This chapter lists things to take into
                 account during development and testing of a BigWorld game in order to help
                 achieve a successful deployment.

                  <p>Developers should be careful not to run blocking operations in the
                           main thread. This applies to the server components which run scripts,
                           including the BaseApp, CellApp and DbMgr (when using class-customised
                           data types). This is required to ensure the process can respond to its
                           peers and manager process in an appropriate time. In an extreme case, a
                           process that pauses for too long may be considered as dead by other
                           server components and stopped via a signal from BWMachineD.
                  </p>
                  <p>This time period is different for different processes. For
                           example, by default, if a CellApp pauses for more than 3 seconds worth
                           of inactivity, the CellAppMgr will kill that CellApp process (a common
                           cause is because of an infinite loop in script). For BaseApps, by
                           default, if they are non-responsive for longer than 5 seconds, the
                           BaseAppMgr will kill that BaseApp process. These limits are
                           configurable, see the <a href="../server_operations_guide/ch02.html" class="olink"><i>Server Configuration with <span class="literal">bw.xml</span></i></a>.
                  </p>

                  <p>It is recommended to review the server warnings during development
                           and to give extra attention to warnings about loading resources in the
                           main thread.
                  </p>
                  <p>Please also note that operations which take a short time in a test
                           environment might take more time in a production environment.

                  <p>Care needs to be taken to avoid situations where Python script
                           makes assumptions that an entity is a Real Entity when it is possible
                           for it to be a Ghost Entity or even an Entity Mailbox. When referring to
                           other entities from script inside an entity, you should never assume
                           that you have a real entity. It is possible for this entity to be a
                           ghost entity or, in some situations, a mailbox to a remote
                           entity.
                  </p>
                  <p>Generally speaking, the <code class="varname">self</code> property will be a
                           real entity but entities passed in as argument or found other ways could
                           be ghost entities or mailboxes. The exception to this is when a method
                           is called on a ghost entity that is not in the entity's def file.
                  </p>
                  <p>To help identify these problems during development, you should
                           enable the <code class="filename">bw.xml</code> option
                           <code class="property">cellApp/treatAllOtherEntitiesAsGhosts</code> and disable
                           the option <code class="property">cellApp/shouldResolveMailBoxes</code> during
                           development. For further details please review <a href="../server_programming_guide/index.html" class="olink">Server Programming Guide</a>'s section <a href="../server_programming_guide/ch23.html" class="olink"><i>Debugging</i></a>.

                  <p>You should validate any input coming from a client, as gamers

                           invalid data.

                           all for <code class="property">&lt;Exposed&gt;</code> methods that the client can
                           call on the server. This is because a <span class="literal">PYTHON</span> argument
                           might contain code which will run on the server.
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="literal">PYTHON</span> arguments are useful when developing
                           game system prototypes, but they should be converted to another data
                           type such as <span class="literal">FIXED_DICT</span> prior to production. You can
                           class-customise <span class="literal">FIXED_DICT</span> and wrap the values with
                           another Python object.
                  </p>
                  <p>Another reason for this restriction is the performance cost of a
                           <span class="literal">PYTHON</span> argument. A <span class="literal">PYTHON</span> argument
                           requires pickling of the data type for every send and receive. This can
                           be much slower than simply reading and writing primitive types, and also
                           takes up more space on the network stream.

                                             database at the same time as this entity. Due to the way the
                                             archiving algorithm is randomised, the time when they are saved to
                                             the database may differ by up to twice the configured archive
