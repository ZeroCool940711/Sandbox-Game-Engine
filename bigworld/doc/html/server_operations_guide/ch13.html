            <p>If a BigWorld server component fails there are some steps that you
                 should follow to assist BigWorld in identifying and resolve the problem as
                 quickly as possible. These steps are outlined briefly below.
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">

                     <p>Retrieve relevant log information.</p>
                  </li>

                     <p>Notify BigWorld Support of the crash.</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>A crash may be either an intentional event such as an
                 <span class="literal">assert</span>, or unintentional event such as segmentation
                 fault. Whenever a crash occurs a core file should be written to the
                 <code class="filename">bigworld/bin/Hybrid64</code> directory (or
                 equivalent directory in your system). These files provide a complete dump of
                 the memory in use by the process at the time the failure occurred and allows
                 deep investigation as to the state of the program which is often necessary
                 to determine the cause of a problem.
            </p>

                     <div>
                        <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e10116"></a>13.1.&nbsp;Change your coredump output directory, if necessary
                        </h2>
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
               <p>By default, processes that crash will output a coredump into their
                      current working directory, which is generally the directory where the
                      binaries reside. This directory may need to be changed if the user running
                      the server does not have sufficient permissions to write to that
                      directory. This may be the case if you have installed using RPM
                      packages.
               </p>
               <p>The output path can be temporarily changed by writing the new output
                      path and the core file pattern to
                      <code class="filename">/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</code>. Note that this will
                      change the coredump output path for all processes (not just BigWorld
                      processes) dumping core on that machine.
               </p>
               <p>For example, a command similar to the following can be used
                      (executed as the root user):
               </p><pre class="programlisting">$ echo "/your/path/here/core.%e.%h.%p" &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</pre><p>Note that the change is only temporary and will not persist across
                      machine restarts.
               </p>
               <p>If a more permanent setting is required, there is the
                      <code class="varname">CORE_PATH</code> shell variable defined in the BWMachined init
                      script that can be set to a suitable output directory. For example, it can
                      be set like this:
               </p><pre class="programlisting">CORE_PATH=/your/path/here</pre><p>The init script is located at<code class="filename">
                         /etc/init.d/bwmachined2</code>. Note that after modifying
                      <code class="varname">CORE_PATH</code>, the BWMachined service will need to be
                      restarted for the changes to take effect.
               </p>

               <p>When diagnosing a crash it is important to find the first process
                      that crashed if there have been multiple process failures. In most
                      scenarios multiple crashes occur due to a single failure that then
                      propagates through the cluster, so it is important to identify where the
                      failure started. There are two methods which can be used to achieve
                      this.

                  </div>
                  <p>Whenever a crash occurs the logs should always be investigated as
                           a first step to check for any known problems or obvious errors that may
                           have occurred. When an issue has been identified, searching around the
                           time period for <span class="literal">CRITICAL</span> and <span class="literal">ERROR</span>
                           messages can help quickly identify the set of processes that failed.
                           Searching through the logs can be performed either via WebConsole and
                           LogViewer, or via the command line utility
                           <code class="filename">mlcat.py</code>. Using the command line utility provides
                           more flexibility for saving logs to a file which can then be collected
                           and sent as part of a BigWorld support ticket.

                  <p>If a process failure occurs due to a non-assertion failure case
                           you may find no obvious <span class="literal">CRITICAL</span> or
                           <span class="literal">ERROR</span> messages appear in the server logs. In this
                           circumstance you will need to search all of the server binary
                           directories within your cluster to find the core files relating to a
                           crash. This sort of operation will generally require a custom script
                           that is suited for your environment as a cluster with hundreds of
                           machines can be time consuming to examine.
                  </p>
                  <p>The easiest way to perform this kind of search is to simply
                           <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> to all the server machines in the cluster and
                           perform a directory listing. Below is the output of a simple
                           chronologically sorted directory listing showing a sequence of core
                           files.

                           CellAppMgr and BaseApp. We then use these assertion files to find the
                           corresponding core files using the PIDs 3018 and 3024. Thus the core

               <p>As you can see from the directory listing in the previous section,
                      core files can be extremely large. One of the most effective ways of
                      notifying BigWorld of a crash is to generate a simple text stack trace of
                      the crash. This can be performed by using the GNU Debugger program
                      <span class="command"><strong>gdb</strong></span>. For example using the BaseApp core file from the
                      previous section we generate a stack trace as follows:
               </p>
               <p>Load the BaseApp binary and core file into GDB.</p><pre class="programlisting">$ gdb baseapp core.baseapp.pc242.3024
