               <p>The BigWorld Server is made up of a set of processes which are used
                  to manage one game shard. These processes are typically run on a cluster
                  of networked machines. The BigWorld Server provides a scalable, reliable
                  game server for an arbitrary number of concurrently connected users. The
                  size of the shard and therefore the number of concurrent users (CCUs) can
                      scale based on customers requirements. Some customers prefer to install
                      multiple BigWorld instances, each dedicated to a different shard, while
                      others deploy one shard for their entire game.
               </p>
               <p>Each instance of the BigWorld Server has multiple processes. The
                      bulk of the cluster machines are dedicated to running CellApps. CellApps
                      run the majority of the actual game code and load is dynamically balanced
                      across them in real-time. Clients do not connect directly to the CellApp
                      machines, rather, each client connects to a BaseApp which acts as a proxy
                      between the client and whichever cell machine its player entity happens to
                      be on at the time. BaseApps run on machines with public IP addresses and
                      essentially act as the firewall for the server cluster. Most of the
                      machines that are not dedicated to running CellApps are dedicated to
                      running BaseApps.
               </p>
               <p>The CellAppMgr and BaseAppMgr are singleton processes that manage
                      the load balancing for CellApps and BaseApps respectively, as well as
                      providing other administrative functions.
               </p>
               <p>The LoginApps validate client logins and are the only processes
                      other than BaseApps which need to run on machines with public IP
                      addresses. The login transaction and all subsequent communication from
                      client to server is encrypted.
               </p>
               <p>The Database Manager (DBMgr) stores persistent data in a MySQL
                      database, and receives periodic back-ups of the server game state. This
                      state is kept consistent and can be restored in the event of hardware or
                      system failure.
               </p>
               <p>To understand the relationship between CellApps, BaseApps and the
                      client, it is important to understand one aspect of how games using
                      BigWorld Technology are architected: game entities are implemented as
                      distributed classes. Each entity can have any combination of Cell, Base,
                      and client parts, which run on the CellApps, BaseApps and clients
                      respectively.

                           a dual objective:

                  <p>This results in an economical, efficient use of resources and a
                           server state that is well-prepared for sudden spikes in load.
                  </p>
                  <p>The primary mechanism by which we implement this dynamic
                           load-balancing scheme is the dynamic allocation and resizing of Cells.
                           Each CellApp controls a number of cells, each of which is responsible
                           for a specific part of a space. The area of each game space is divided
                           between one or more cells as is necessary to keep the load on the
                           controlling CellApps below a configured threshold. The areas controlled
                           by cells do not overlap, and the cells collectively span all areas of
                           all spaces in the game world. See <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#xref_Figure_SpaceViewer_3_Cells">SpaceViewer Screenshot</a> below for an example of how
                           a number of cells share the load for a single space.
                  </p>
                  <p>As the load on a particular cell increases, its total area is
                           dynamically reduced by the CellAppMgr, and entities are offloaded onto
                           adjacent cells to balance the load between available CellApps. As the
                           average system load increases past the configured threshold for a
                           particular space, the CellAppMgr will add a new cell and assign it to a
                           CellApp that doesn't already have a cell in that space. As the average
                           system load decreases, the CellAppMgr will start to retire Cells,
                           releasing their associated CellApps from the space, in order to maintain
                           the average load at the configured threshold.
                  </p>
                  <p>This aspect of the server&#8217;s design is based on the heuristic that,
                           generally, entities are interested in other entities that are spatially
                           nearby. Since each cell controls entities in a continuous region of a
                           space, in most cases the interactions between these entities can be
                           resolved locally without having to communicate with another CellApp.
                           This minimises network traffic and its associated (and significant) CPU
                           usage, delivering maximum efficiency and server capacity.
                  </p>
                  <p>While the load balancing algorithm for Cells is dynamic, the
                           algorithm for BaseApps is currently static (although there is work
                           underway to modify this behaviour), in that the base part of an entity
                           is (usually) created on the least loaded BaseApp and is never offloaded.
                           A reasonable turnover (i.e. rate of creation and destruction) in a
                           system keeps the load balanced evenly over the available
                           BaseApps.
                  </p>
                  <p>The design for BaseApp load balancing is based on the assumption
                           that the majority of game code is executed on the CellApp, so that the
                           largest proportion of game code execution can be dynamically rather than
                           statically load balanced. The Base part of a player entity spends most
                           of its time forwarding packets between the client and its cell entity,
                           and since the downstream bit-rate is held constant, BaseApp load tends
                           not to fluctuate in the way that CellApp load can. To date, this static
                           balancing scheme is more than sufficient to distribute load
                           evenly.

                  <p>An important feature of the BigWorld Server is that load scales
                           roughly linearly with respect to number of entities. More specifically,
                           for all other variables such as AI, frequency of activity, etc. held
                           constant, increasing the number of entities (clients and NPCs) should
                           produce a linear proportional increase in overall server load.
                  </p>
                  <p>This is important because it means that a BigWorld Server has no
                           "glass ceiling" for performance, where the amount of extra hardware
                           required to progressively increase the entity capacity of the server
                           would become prohibitive. Simply put, with a BigWorld Server, if you
                           want to double the number of entities, you double the amount of hardware
                           in the cluster -- The server will expand as much as the customer base
                           requires for a predictable cost.
                  </p>
                  <p>The BigWorld Server achieves these linear scaling characteristics
                           by two main methods: controlling the amount of downstream bandwidth
                           available to each client; and limiting the vision of each entity to a
                           predetermnined range. Since a large proportion of total server CPU
                           consumption is taken up by the formation and sending of packets, setting
                           a maximum downstream bit-rate per client results in load that is linear
                           to the number of clients once each client reaches this bandwidth
                           limit.
                  </p>
                  <p>Without these scaling mechanism in place, the server load would be
                           quadratic in the number of clients: as the number of clients increases,
                           the number of other entities each client can see will increase at
                           roughly the same rate, giving an
                           <em class="emphasis">O(n<sup>2</sup>)</em> complexity for
                           downstream traffic and server load.
                  </p>
                  <p>To make sure that clients are not disadvantaged by bandwidth
                           limits, we prioritise updates for nearby entities when constructing
                           downstream packets. Entities closest to the client avatar are given a
                           greater share of the bandwidth and will be updated more frequently;
                           entities further away are given less share of the bandwidth, and are
                           updated less frequently. The client has filters to smooth the movement
                           for entities between updates, so movement will appear smooth even for
                           distant entities that have sparse updates. As the client approaches an
                           entity that is far away, the update rate is increased smoothly so that
                           interactions become more and more responsive.
                  </p>
                  <p>Strictly speaking, server load should increase at a slightly
                           super-linear rate once downstream bandwidth is fully utilised. Although
                           the amount being sent per client remains constant, the algorithm that
                           prioritises the entities and determines which ones are updated is
                           logarithmic in the number of entities surrounding the client avatar. The
                           coefficient of this logarithmic part of the complexity is expected to be
                           very small relative to the linear part related to forming and sending
                           packets.
                  </p>
                  <p>This implies that having excessive entity density in a small area
                           can have an impact on performance on the server. However, entity density
                           is a problem not just for the server, but for the client as well. Having
                           too high an entity density in one area will decrease the client
                           performance from the additional rendering that is needed. A good game
                           design should ensure that entity densities are kept at levels that are
                           appropriate for ensuring good end-user experience. Our experience has
                           been that having two thousand entities in a small area (a few hundred
                           metres square) is handled well by the server, and if appropriate
                           rendering is used on the client performance can be acceptable there
                           also.

                     <p>The aim of first level fault tolerance is to handle isolated
                                server component or machine failures. When components or machines are
                                found to be no longer reachable for whatever reason, the system
                                recovers transparently to the user so that gameplay continues with as
                                little disruption as possible.
                     </p>
                     <p>CellApps implement fault tolerance by having each cell entity
                                back-up its state to its Base entity at regular intervals. If the
                                CellApp goes down for any reason, Base entities will detect that their
                                cell parts are no longer contactable and re-create their cell entity
                                on another available CellApp.
                     </p>
                     <p>For BaseApps, fault tolerance is currently implemented by having
                                the BaseApps back up amongst themselves. Each base entity is backed up
                                to another BaseApp and is sent periodic backup updates. If a BaseApp
                                goes down, the other BaseApps will restore the backed up base entities
                                that were on that BaseApp.
                     </p>
                     <p>A sentinel process called "Reviver" provides fault tolerance for
                                the remaining server components (LoginApp, CellAppMgr, BaseAppMgr, and
                                DBMgr). If any of these processes fail, the Reviver will detect it and
                                immediately start a new instance of that process to ensure continuity
                                of gameplay.

                     <p>The second level of fault tolerance deals with massive
                                system-wide failures (e.g. power outages, disruption to network
                                hardware etc) and is implemented by the DBMgr and the BaseApps. The
                                aim of second level fault tolerance is to ensure data integrity rather
                                than continued gameplay. By the time this stage of fault tolerance has
                                been engaged it is safe to assume the server is no longer in a state
                                where it can properly function.
                     </p>
                     <p>The BigWorld Server continually conducts a rolling distributed
                                backup of the game state to a distributed database. For critical state
                                changes (such as item trades) the database write can be manually
                                invoked to ensure the gamestate is preserved irrespective of where the
                                rolling writeback is up to. Once the cause of the system-wide
                                disruption has been identified and fixed, the game can be restarted
                                from the game state stored in the database.
                     </p>
                     <p>The second level fault tolerance mechanism is implemented using
                                a distributed database system in the form of a secondary database for
                                each BaseApp. This ensures scalability, and removes the DBMgr as a
                                potential bottleneck. In addition, there is support for snapshotting
                                the server state during online operation.
