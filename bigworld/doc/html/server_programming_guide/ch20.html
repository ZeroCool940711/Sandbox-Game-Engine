            <p>This chapter discusses some general issues that programmers
                 implementing game systems should keep in mind, and also provides some
                 example design and implementation of common systems used in MMOGs.

               <p>In general, server processing load, internal network bandwidth and
                      external network bandwidth scales linearly to the number of players if
                      player and entity density remain constant. There is a small extra cost as
                      density increases.
               </p>
               <p>Capacity can be added by:</p>

                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Adding a combination of both more BaseApps and more CellApps to

               <p>CellAppMgr, BaseAppMgr and DBMgr are single instances and are
                      theoretically scaling bottlenecks. CellAppMgr and BaseAppMgr are only
                      concerned with managing CellApps and BaseApps and have very low load. They
                      can scale to handling thousands of BaseApps and CellApps. Although
                      BigWorld's design does not make heavy use of the database, the main
                      concern for scaling is DBMgr. This is addressed below in BigWorld Database
                      Scalability.

               <p>The number of BaseApps and CellApps required to sufficiently service
                      an entity population should generally scale linearly with the number of
                      entities. Most communication between entities is with those that are
                      nearby. This is handled by keeping those entities together on CellApps as
                      much as possible. Other communication involves point-to-point
                      communication using remote method calls. The main issue here is to try to
                      minimise situations where entities need to be looked up globally.
               </p>
               <p>The DBMgr functionality for writing out entity state is distributed
                      across the secondary databases for each BaseApp and consolidated when the
                      entity is retired. See BigWorld Database Scalability below.
               </p>
               <p>The general strategy to combating bottlenecks in game script is to
                      avoid global game systems where possible, such as having singleton
                      entities that control some operation of the game, for example, trading. In
                      general, these bottlenecks can be avoided by restructuring game script and
                      using distributed object methods to implement such global sub-systems,
                      rather than entrusting the request handling to a single entity. An example
                      of this is presented below (see AoI-based trading below).

                        </h2>
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
               <p>Updates to some of the entities in a player's AoI are propagated to
                      the player's client every game tick (by default,
                      <span class="literal">gameUpdateHertz</span> is 10Hz). The amount of update data
                      sent to the player's client is constrained to a downstream bit rate (by
                      default, <span class="literal">bitsPerSecondToClient</span> is 20kbps).
               </p>
               <p>These updates consist of property changes and method calls. Every
                      cell entity keeps a history of these changes, and for each entity in a
                      player's AoI, the player is updated incrementally about that entity
                      periodically. The position and direction data of an entity is specially
                      treated so that only the most recent value of these properties (so called
                      volatile properties) is sent to the client, instead of the full history of
                      the property.
               </p>
               <p>Internally, entities in an AoI are in a priority queue. The priority
                      of an entity in a player's AoI determines how long it will be before the
                      next update about that entity occurs to the player. Generally speaking,
                      entities closer to the player are updated more frequently than those that
                      are towards the edge of a player's AoI. Properties can have
                      <em class="emphasis">Level of Detail</em> (LoD) rules applied so that these
                      properties will only be updated if the entity is close enough to the
                      player. See the chapter <a href="ch05.html#xref_LOD_Level_Of_Detail_On_Properties" class="olink">LOD (Level of Detail) on Properties</a>.
               </p>
               <p>In general, many game operations are localised to the specific area
                      that a player inhabits. Load balance partitioning is done across each
                      space depending on the load being generated per cell. As entity densities
                      increase, the partitioning scheme changes in response to equalise the load
                      amongst the cells servicing a space. The amount of data per entity that is
                      sent to the client is also reduced as the density of entities increases.
                      This reduces a lot of the extra cost due to density and also makes good
                      use of the client's bandwidth.
               </p>
               <p>However, very high entity densities can cause problems by causing
                      each periodic update to a player client to be overrun with excessive
                      amounts of entity event data. Recall that the amount of downstream
                      bandwidth is a configurable constant. Due to the prioritising of change
                      events of entities in a player's AoI, this can cause updates of entities
                      further away to be starved if there are many more entities that are closer
                      to the player.
               </p>
               <p>Increasing the downstream bandwidth can improve on this situation,
                      but eventually, it is usually the client that becomes the limiting factor.
                      There is a per-entity cost of processing on game clients, for
                      example:

               </div>
               <p>There is also a limit to the amount of information that a player can
                      comprehend. With large numbers of entities nearby, less information tends
                      to be needed for distant entities.

               <p>Extreme entity densities that can negatively affect the end-user
                      experience can be avoided with good game design.

               <p>A brief discussion of the operation of DBMgr and implications for
                      scalability follow.
               </p>
               <p>When entities are checked out of the database, they are assigned to
                      the least-loaded BaseApp. Once entities are loaded onto a BaseApp they do
                      not generally migrate away from that BaseApp unless that BaseApp process
                      terminates, in which case they are restored on other BaseApps in the
                      system. See the chapter <a class="xref" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;16.&nbsp;Fault Tolerance"><i>Fault Tolerance</i></a>.
               </p>
               <p>For each entity that resides on it, the BaseApp is responsible for
                      collecting all the explicit script writes (from calls to
                      <code class="methodname">BigWorld.writeToDB()</code>) for that entity over its
                      checked-out lifetime, as well as the periodic backups for that entity.
                      These writes are performed on a secondary database stored on the BaseApp
                      machine. There can be arbitrarily many BaseApps in a cluster, and entities
                      are statically load-balanced across them when they are instantiated. That
                      is, they are assigned to the least-loaded BaseApp.
               </p>
               <p>When the entity is destroyed, it is checked back into the primary
                      database, this results in the sum of the database writes in the BaseApp
                      secondary database for that entity being consolidated back into the
                      primary database on the DBMgr.
               </p>
               <p>This consolidation can be a bottleneck, and there are future
                      features planned to reduce this so as to not overload the DBMgr. In
                      general, writing back to the primary database is not a time-critical
                      operation, so that checking entities back into the database is a
                      fire-and-forget operation. No data loss is possible as the data is
                      persisted on the secondary database, and not removed until the
                      consolidation for that entity is done.
               </p>
               <p>On server shutdown, all checked-out entities have their database
                      writes consolidated back into the primary database. If an unexpected
                      failure occurs (e.g. power failure), this consolidation can take place on
                      the next server startup.
               </p>
               <p>The following operations on the DBMgr can still be a
                      bottleneck:

               <p>In practice, looking up which BaseApp an entity is checked out to
                      (by name or database ID) is a read operation and comparatively inexpensive
                      due to the underlying MySQL query cache. However, schemes such as the
                      <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entity (see Player Lookup below) can
                      be implemented which can offload the task of handling lookup requests from
                      the DBMgr to game script running on arbitrarily many BaseApps.
               </p>
               <p>However, the global DBMgr process will still place an implicit limit
                      on how quickly entities can be loaded from, and saved to, persistent
                      storage. Future improvements being considered include sharding the
                      database to spread this load over many external databases.

                  <p>Using <code class="methodname">BigWorld.lookUpBaseByName()</code> causes
                           a query to DBMgr (which causes a read on the primary database), while
                           sufficient for many scenarios (and empirically works in many released
                           BigWorld-based games), introduces a potential bottleneck. The discussion
                           below outlines a design for a distributed mapping of player names to
                           player mailboxes which effectively offloads this load to BaseApp game
                           script, which can be scaled up by adding more BaseApps.
                  </p>
                  <p>The idea is to have multiple <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code>
                           Base entities that contain a distributed mapping of player names to
                           player mailboxes. These <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entities
                           have no geospatial representation, they exist only as a system service,
                           and so generate no load with respect to AoI updates.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each BaseApp has a corresponding
                           <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entity - this spreads the
                           <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entities out and protects against
                           BaseApp failures. Having more than one
                           <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entity per BaseApp does not add
                           any additional redundancy benefit.
                  </p>
                  <p><code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entity instances register
                           themselves globally. Globally registered bases have their mailboxes
                           registered under a string key in a global bases mapping that is
                           synchronised across every BaseApp. Player names are hashed against the
                           known number of player registries, and a particular
                           <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> instance is located via the Global
                           Bases mechanism (see <a class="xref" href="ch13.html#xref_Global_Bases" title="13.7.&nbsp;Global Bases">Global Bases</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>When player entities are created, they add themselves to the
                           distributed registry by hashing their own name to the appropriate
                           <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entity, and registering their base
                           mailbox with that <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entity. On
                           logout, they contact that same <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> to
                           notify it of the logout, and this results in the removal of the mapping
                           between that player name and that player mailbox. A scheme for
                           rebalancing the player registry entries can be implemented which
                           re-balances the entries across the <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code>
                           entities when a new <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> is added or
                           removed, such that the hash scheme remains consistent.
                  </p>
                  <p>Queries for a particular player name are done by first hashing the
                           player name to be looked up to the appropriate
                           <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code>, and then querying one of the
                           multiple <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entities via a remote
                           method, and a callback remote method with a mailbox. Requests for player
                           lookup are asynchronous, and caller entities implement a callback method
                           that is called back when the lookup is complete.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> needs a persistent
                           mailbox list for fault tolerance purposes, so that the registry is
                           restored to another BaseApp along with the
                           <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entity if the BaseApp it formerly
                           resides on fails. In this case, it is likely that it will be restored to
                           another BaseApp which already has its own
                           <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code>, so re-balancing should be done
                           and then the restored <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> should be
                           destroyed.
                  </p>
                  <p>This system can be scaled up by increasing the number of BaseApps
                           to handle queries. Tiered request schemes could also be used to avoid
                           large numbers of globally registered base entities becoming a
                           bottleneck.

                  <p>The scalability of SMTP/IMAP mail servers can be leveraged here.
                           Note that these game mail servers are completely internal to the game -
                           no public access would be allowed (though this would be up to the game
                           design).
                  </p>
                  <p>Each player has an associated email address. BaseApps can query
                           IMAP servers asynchronously using a TCP socket registered with BigWorld,
                           without blocking game script. Python has good support for communication
                           with IMAP over a socket (see the chapter <a class="xref" href="ch33.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;33.&nbsp;Non-Blocking Socket I/O Using Mercury"><i>Non-Blocking Socket I/O Using Mercury</i></a>)
                  </p>
                  <p>Items can be gifted using special attachments or special email
                           headers, depending on the item system used. Item data would never be
                           directly sent via email, instead, gifted items over email would be held
                           in escrow, as with AoI-based player item trading. See Inventory and Item
                           trading below.

                  <p>Store a fixed amount of inventory item slots per-player on the
                           player entity to limit the amount of inventory data that is associated
                           with player inventory.
                  </p>
                  <p>Some popular MMOs have the concept of banks where players must be
                           in a specific area to access items stored at the bank. This could be a
                           separate entity that is loaded on request when a player is accessing
                           their bank, and then destroyed once they leave the bank. The capacity of
                           the on-player inventory and the bank inventory could be tuned to
                           optimise database load.
                  </p>
                  <p>With the on-player inventory, this can be stored as a BigWorld
                           ARRAY of item descriptors. Item descriptors themselves would be
                           persisted as a BigWorld <span class="type">FIXED_DICT</span>, but could be
                           class-customised when loaded from the database so that items are
                           represented in script as an arbitrary object type.
                  </p>
                  <p>Player inventory changes are expected to be frequent. Per-element
                           changes in a BigWorld <span class="type">ARRAY</span> are propagated to the client
                           with a description of the change path to that element and the new
                           element value (i.e. the entire array is not sent from the server to the
                           client each time an element is changed).
                  </p>
                  <p>If each time the inventory is changed, the entity wrote its state
                           out to the secondary database, then a bottleneck can occur, as this
                           operation is expected to be frequent.
                  </p>
                  <p>In this case, we rely on the fault tolerance mechanism for
                           ensuring against data loss. This works by periodically saving out the
                           state of the entity to another process. That other process is
                           responsible for restoring the entity in the event of a process failure.
                           For example, cell entity data is backed up to the corresponding base
                           entity's BaseApp, and base entities are backed up to other BaseApps.
                           This is the first level of fault tolerance, and the frequency of backups
                           can be configured.
                  </p>
                  <p>There is also a second level of fault tolerance, which is the
                           periodic archiving of the base and cell entity state to the secondary
                           databases. The frequency of this can similarly tuned to achieve optimum
                           BaseApp load.
                  </p>
                  <p>However, for important changes to the item inventory, for example,
                           a quest item, game script can request a write to the secondary database
                           and have that confirmed via an <code class="methodname">onWriteToDB()</code>
                           callback. For trading transactions between two players, see
                           below.

                           entity. When the <code class="classname">Escrow</code> entity receives
                           acknowledgements from the two players that the trade has been cancelled,
                           it deletes itself from the database.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each player can signal to the <code class="classname">Escrow</code> entity
                           that it is willing to accept the trade as it stands. Once the
                           <code class="classname">Escrow </code>entity receives positive notification for
                           both parties, it transfers ownership of the items to the corresponding
                           opposing players by signalling to the player the item data that they
                           have traded.

                                        acknowledges that they have the items by calling back on the

                                        itself from the database.

                  <p>Total database writes: 2 for each offer made, and at least 2
                           offers are made. 3 writes for the transfer stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>This illustrates that trading can potentially be an expensive
                           operation in terms of writes to disk. However, all the writes are
                           distributed amongst the entities involved, and most would be written to
                           the secondary database. Only one of the database writes, when the
                           <code class="classname">Escrow</code> entity is destroyed, results in the
                           primary database being utilised, in order to remove that
                           <code class="classname">Escrow</code> entity from persistent storage.
                  </p>
                  <p>Note that each participating entity in a trading transaction is
                           not required to be on the same process. This scales well because there
                           can be an arbitrary number of BaseApps, and players and Escrow entities
                           would be uniformly distributed amongst the BaseApps. Recall that while
                           CellApps have player distributions that map to where they are spatially,
                           base entities on BaseApps do not have this spatial relation.
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a cost to the primary database associated with the
                           creation and destruction of each <code class="classname">Escrow</code> entity.
                           This design can be improved by consolidating the escrow operations to
                           target a pre-existing <code class="classname">EscrowManager</code> entity rather
                           than creating and destroying <code class="classname">Escrow</code> entities. A
                           similar scheme could be implemented to the
                           <code class="classname">PlayerRegistry</code> entities by having an
                           <code class="classname">EscrowManager</code> entity per BaseApp. Trading
                           entities would nominate and agree on a random
                           <code class="classname">EscrowManager</code> to use for their trading
                           transaction.
