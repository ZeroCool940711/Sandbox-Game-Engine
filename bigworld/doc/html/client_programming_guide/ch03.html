            <p>The placement of the camera update within the general update process
               is a delicate matter, because the camera depends on some components having
                 been updated before it, whilst other components depend on the camera being
                 updated before them.
            </p>
            <p>Conceptually, there are four types of camera: fixed camera, FlexiCam,
                 cursor camera, and free camera. The first three are client-controlled views,
                 ranging from minimum user interaction to maximum user interaction. The last
                 camera is completely user-controlled, but is not part of actual game
                 play.
            </p>
            <p>There are however just three camera classes:
                 <code class="classname">FlexiCam</code>, <code class="classname">CursorCamera</code>, and
                 <code class="classname">FreeCamera</code>. The fixed camera is implemented with a
                 <code class="classname">FlexiCam</code> object. They all derive from a common
                 <code class="classname">BaseCamera</code> class.
            </p>
            <p>There is only ever one active camera at a time. The personality script
                 usually handles camera management, since the camera is a global, but any
                 script can also manipulate the camera, and the player script often does
                 (although usually indirectly, through the personality script)
            </p>
            <p>The base class and all the derived classes are fully accessible to
                 Python. Any camera can be created and set to whatever position a script
                 desires, including to the position of another camera. This is particularly
                 useful when switching camera types to remove any unwanted
                 'jump-cuts'.

               <p>The cursor camera is a camera that follows the character in the game
                      world. It always positions itself on a sphere centred on the character's
                      head. It works primarily with the direction cursor so as to face the
                      camera in the direction of the character's head. You may use any
                      MatrixProvider in place of the direction cursor, and you may use any
                      MatrixProvider in place of the player's head.
               </p>
               <p>The direction cursor is an input handler that translates device
                      input from the user into the manipulation of an imaginary cursor that
                      travels on an invisible sphere. This cursor is described by its pitch and
                      yaw. It produces a pointing vector extending from the head position of the
                      player's avatar in world space, in the direction of the cursor's pitch and
                      yaw. The direction cursor is a useful tool to allow a targeting method
                      across different devices. Rather than have each device affect the camera
                      and character mesh, each device talks to the direction cursor, affecting
                      its look-at vector in the world. The cursor camera, target tracker, and
                      action matcher then read the direction cursor for information on what
                      needs to be done.
               </p>
               <p>The cursor camera takes the position of the direction cursor on the
                      sphere, extends the line back towards the character's head, and follows
                      that line until it intersects with the sphere on the other side. This
                      intersection point is the cursor camera's position. The direction of the
                      camera is always that of the direction cursor.
               </p>
               <p>The cursor camera is an instance of the abstract concept
                      InputCursor. There can be only one active InputCursor at any time, and
                      BigWorld automatically forwards keyboard, joystick, and mouse events to
                      it. Upon startup, the cursor camera is the active InputCursor by default.
                      You can change the active InputCursor at any time, using the method
                      BigWorld.setCursor (for example to change the InputCursor to be a mouse
                      pointer instead).

               <p>The Free Camera is a free roaming camera that is neither tied to a
                      fixed point in space nor following the player's avatar. It is controlled
                      by the mouse (for direction) and keyboard (for movement), and allows the
                      user to fly about the world. The free camera has inertia in order to
                      provide smooth, gradual transitions in movement. It is not a gameplay
                      camera, but is useful for debugging, development, and demonstration of the
                      game.

               <p>The FlexiCam is a flexible camera that follows the character in the
                      game world. It always positions itself at a specified point, relative to
                      the character orientation, and always looks at a specified orientation,
                      relative to the character's feet direction.
               </p>
               <p>It is called FlexiCam because it has a certain amount of elasticity
                      to its movement, allowing the sensation of speed to be visualised. This
                      makes it especially useful for chasing vehicles.
