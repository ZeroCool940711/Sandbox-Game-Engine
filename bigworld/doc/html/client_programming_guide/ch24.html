               <p>The job system allows additional cores in multicore systems to
                      execute code and calculate data for rendering just in time. It also moves
                      the issue of D3D commands onto its own core, with the main thread simply
                      recording them for execution in the next frame.
               </p>
               <p>The rendering of a frame is divided into blocks. Blocks are rendered
                      in order. Each block begins only after the previous block has
                      finished.
               </p>
               <p>Each block consists of any D3D rendering commands and associated
                      vertex and index buffers, textures, shader constants or any other data.
                      The block can be produced as a combination of conventional D3D rendering
                      from the main thread and output from jobs running in parallel on cores
                      allocated to run jobs.
               </p>
               <p>Any number of jobs can produce the input for a block. Since only one
                      block is rendering at a time and jobs execute in parallel you should use
                      at least as many jobs as there are cores, otherwise there will be idle
                      cores. Jobs within a block can finish in any order, but the block will not
                      be rendered until all jobs are complete. While the jobs are executing D3D
                      executes the previous block. Thus the job cores and the D3D core are
                      constantly working while at the same time the main thread is preparing
                      another frame of blocks and their corresponding jobs.

               <p>All rendering commands and jobs are stored in a command buffer. This
                      is accomplished by wrapping D3D. All D3D function calls go to the wrapper
                      which records them to be executed on the next frame while at the same time
                      the commands from the previous frame are executed in another thread on the
                      D3D core.
               </p>
               <p>When flushed the D3D core first stalls for the results of the first
                      block's jobs. Meanwhile each core in the job cluster starts grabbing jobs
                      from the block. There is no central dispatch mechanism. The cores grab
                      jobs and atomically decrement a counter for that block when they finish
                      writing their results. Note that jobs are grabbed in order but they are
                      not necessarily finished in order. For example, if the first job takes a
                      long time the second might finish first and that core can begin on another
                      job. This means that the output is not guaranteed to be contiguous until
                      after the last job finishes and decrements the counter to zero.
               </p>
               <p>Only then can the D3D core begin to process the results of the first
                      block, while the cluster begins to operate on the second block, outputting
                      the results into another buffer.
               </p>
               <p>If the D3D core finishes first it retires the buffer and stalls
                      until its next buffer is ready. If the cluster finishes first it stalls
                      until the D3D core retires the buffer it is consuming so it can receive
                      output from the cluster.

               <p>In addition to wrapping D3D the wrapper has a small API to control

               </p>
               <p><code class="code">DX::newBlock()</code>: Starts a new block. All rendering from
                      the previous block will finish before this one will begin and all job
                      output that was used to render the previous block will no longer be
                      accessible. What this means is that all jobs producing output for this
                      block must be allocated before the next call to
                      <code class="code">DX::newBlock()</code>.
               </p>
               <p><code class="code">DX::setWrapperFlags()</code> and
                      <code class="code">DX::getWrapperFlags()</code>: These functions get and set flags that
                      control the behaviour of the wrapper.
               </p>
               <p><code class="code">IMMEDIATE_LOCK</code>: Flush the command buffer and then
                      execute the lock in the main thread. This is required if you are not going
                      to fill in the entire locked region. It is an extremely expensive way to
                      lock and should be avoided where possible.
               </p>
               <p><code class="code">DEFERRED_LOCK</code>: This flag is used to lock a buffer that
                      will be filled in with a job. The pointer that a lock returns can only be
                      used to store into a job and then accessed when the job executes. The
                      actual lock occurs in the next frame when the job executes.

               <p>The Job System API is accessed through the JobSystem singleton. It
                      is obtained with <code class="code">JobSystem::instance()</code>.
               </p>
               <p><code class="code">allocJob()</code>: This method places a job into the list of
                      jobs for the current block and returns a user implemented class derived
                      from Job. This has a virtual function called <code class="code">execute()</code> which
                      actually performs the job. The derived class stores anything necessary for
                      the execution of the job. Note that the jobs within a block will not
                      execute in order.
               </p>
               <p><code class="code">allocOutput()</code>: The job will need to produce output and
                      this is allocated up front with <code class="code">allocOutput()</code>. It is called
                      from the main thread and its result is placed into the Job object. The
                      memory for the output is not actually allocated at this time, but it will
                      be made ready at the time that the job is executed next frame.
               </p>
               <p>Within a block you can have any mix of job and output allocations.
                      For example, you may allocate one output and divide it between many jobs
                      or vice versa or any combination you like. The only rule is that the
                      output and the jobs must all come from the same block.

               <p>Now that we understand how this example works we can go through the
                      steps of implementing it.
               </p>
               <p>First we need to implement our job object.</p><pre class="programlisting">class PointSpriteParticleJob : public Job
{
public:
    void set( Particle* particles, Moo::VertexXYZDP* pVertex, uint nPoints );
    virtual void execute();

private:
    Particle* particles_;
    Moo::VertexXYZDP* pVertex_;
    uint nPoints_;
};
</pre><p>The job object inherits the virtual <code class="code">execute()</code> method
                      which gets called in the next frame just before the output of the job will
                      be needed for consumption by the D3D core.
               </p>
               <p>We also implement a <code class="code">set()</code> method which gets called from
                      the main thread and stores all the information that will be needed in
                      <code class="code"> execute()</code>.
               </p>
               <p>The <code class="code">execute()</code> method will do two things. It will update
                      the positions of the particles and output the new positions into a vertex
                      buffer. Each given job object will do this for only a part of the particle
                      system and vertex buffer so that the entire task can be divided into
                      several jobs and execute in parallel on several cores.
               </p>
               <p>Now we are ready to use the job class in our rendering code.</p>
               <p>We begin this with a new block.</p><pre class="programlisting">DX::newBlock();
</pre><p>Now we are ready to queue our rendering commands.</p>
               <p>First we need to lock a deferred vertex buffer, and to do this we
                      need to set the appropriate wrapper flag before locking.
               </p>
               <p>Normally when locking you get a pointer that you can use immediately
                      to write vertex data. However our vertex data will be calculated in the
                      next frame by jobs, so the lock actually has to occur at that time.
                      Therefore we use a deferred lock which returns a pointer now but does not
                      perform the lock until required.
               </p><pre class="programlisting">uint32 oldFlags = DX::getWrapperFlags();
DX::setWrapperFlags( DX::WRAPPER_FLAG_DEFERRED_LOCK );

Moo::DynamicVertexBufferBase2&lt;Moo::VertexXYZDP&gt;&amp; vb = Moo::DynamicVertexBufferBase2&lt;Moo::VertexXYZDP&gt;::instance();
Moo::VertexXYZDP* pVertex = vb.lock2( 4096 );
</pre><p>Now we are ready to allocate and set up our jobs. The pointer from
                      the lock is used to set up the jobs.
               </p><pre class="programlisting">for ( uint i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++ )
{
    job = jobSystem.allocJob&lt;UpdateParticlesJob&gt;();
    job.set( particles + i*512, vertices + i*512, 512 );
}
</pre><p>Finally we can unlock the buffer, reset the wrapper flags and
                      render.
               </p>
               <p>At this point we can render as if the jobs that we have allocated
                      and set are complete, since the following rendering commands will not be
                      executed until that time.
               </p><pre class="programlisting">vb.unlock();
uint32 lockIndex = vb.lockIndex();

DX::setWrapperFlags( oldFlags );

vb.set( 0 );
Moo::rc().drawPrimitive( D3DPT_POINTLIST, lockIndex, nPoints );
