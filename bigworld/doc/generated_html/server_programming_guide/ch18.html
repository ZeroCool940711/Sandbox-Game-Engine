                        <p>When a player logs in to a BigWorld server, he sends a username
                                   and a password. These are compared to a server-side database, to make
                                   sure that the user is subscribed.

                        <p>The source code is available to the login procedure, so this

                                      be someone else, by spoofing another player's data.</em></p>
                        <p>When a player logs in to a BigWorld server, the server sends a
                                   32-bit session key back to the client. The client must use this key in
                                   all further packets sent to the server, or the packet will be
                                   rejected.
                        </p>
                        <p>Optionally, the server can also send to the client an
                                   authentication key with every packet. This makes it very hard for an
                                   attacker to successfully masquerade as the server.
                        </p>
                        <p>Also, every command called on the server has the client's ID
                                   added to the arguments. This is done by the BaseApp before the command
                                   is transmitted, so the client cannot fake the ID.

                                      data to gain privileged information, or injecting new packets into

                        <p>All traffic between the client and server is encrypted. The
                                   credentials sent to the server during login are RSA-encrypted and all
                                   client-server traffic after this point is encrypted with 128-bit modal
                                   Blowfish. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to inject new
                                   packets into either the upstream or downstream traffic; without
                                   knowing the Blowfish key, the probability of generating a packet that
                                   will parse correctly and not be discarded is extremely low.
                        </p>
                        <p>It would still be possible for a player to hack its own binary
                                   and sniff the data stream from the server after it has been
                                   decrypted.

                        <p>This is a common problem on MMOGs that receive data that is not

               <p>Additionally, each server component is only required to listen for

                      all clients (as opposed to a distinct port for each) also has the

                        <p>But since an MMOG client must connect to a server to play the

                                   that, in addition to the username and password, the CD key is also
                                   sent to the server and checked against a database.

               <p>As a developer, you need to watch out for hacked clients, and third
                      party apps (often called 'trainers'). It is also important to realise that
                      it is very hard to prevent all forms of cheating. You should decide what
                      forms of cheating will impact you and/or your customers, and work on those
                      issues, and do not let minor cheating distract you.
               </p>
               <p>The most important rule is to always be careful with data sent from
                      the client. If possible, everything that the client does should be checked
                      for validity on the server. Simple rules, like ensuring that a switch can
                      only be activated when the player is close enough to throw the lever, are
                      easy to enforce. To simplify these checks, an extra 'source' argument is
                      added to the parameter list for every method exposed to the client. The
                      client does not send it up <span class="symbol">&#8208;</span> it is
                      added by the BaseApp automatically. Also, to make it harder for clients to
                      cheat, methods not exposed to the client are excised from the address
                      space that it sees.
               </p>
               <p>Generalised physics checking on more frequent interactions, such as
                      movement, is not so easy, since running the physics of every player on the
                      server would be quite expensive. One solution is to use the high-level
                      geometry of the world as the expression of the important physical rules.
                      The world is built up of polyhedral chunks connected by portals. A chunk
                      equates to one room in inside areas. Whenever the player moves between
                      chunks, we check that the movement passes through a portal, and that the
                      player has not moved too fast. This means that we are not concerned about
                      petty violations of physical rules, like standing in the middle of a
                      table, but we do catch violations that influence the game, like moving
                      through walls or locked doors, and moving too quickly.

                  </div>
                  <p>The general rule is to send data to the client only if it is
                           necessary. This saves bandwidth, as well as helping reduce hacking.
                           There are three techniques you can use with BigWorld Technology:
                  </p>
                  <div class="itemizedlist">

                           <p>Instead of constantly sending entity information, you might
                                        want to send it only when it is within range. For example, a player
                                        might be able to see a monster from 500 metres away, but its level
                                        does not have to be sent to the client until it is within 20
                                        metres.
                           </p>

                           <p>Some information should never be sent to the client. For
                                        example, NPC health could be kept local to the server, and the
                                        client can just call functions that affect it
                                        (<em class="emphasis">e.g.</em>, <span class="literal">doDamage(10)</span>). The
                                        server sends the results to the client (<em class="emphasis">e.g.</em>,
                                        monster limping because health is below 50%).
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p><em class="emphasis">Data on request</em></p>
                           <p>The client should call server functions to request data only
                                        when needed. For example, your game could be designed such that the
                                        client must physically 'con' a monster by calling a server-side
                                        function that returns level and health. To detect potential cheating
                                        the server could then flag clients that con more than one monster
                                        per second, or con monsters further than 20 metres away.

                  <p>As much as security is important, as a developer you have to be
                           careful so that it does not impact too much the player's experience of
                           the game.
                  </p>
                  <p>The game has to be responsive, but the game play may feel very
                           lagged if the client passed all movement and combat commands to the
                           server for validation before showing results. Therefore, you are best
                           off handling movement on the client side, or simultaneously on the
                           client and the server. For example, to have a fast-paced shooting game,
                           you would need to perform client-side tests for impact, and show the
                           result immediately (monster recoils when hit, etc...). Simultaneously,
                           you would send the shoot command to the server, and let the server send
                           down any changes of health if the monster is really hit. This means that
                           the client cannot cheat with shooting, but still gets lag-free
                           results.

                  <p>This is one of the biggest issues in controlling hacking. For
                           example, it may be too expensive to check all player physics on the
                           server. The developer has to pick the most common forms of cheating, and
                           check for those.
                  </p>
                  <p>It is sensible to allow checks to be turned on and off per player,
                           or only check 10% of the players at any one time. Statistical checking
                           can be useful, for example by monitoring how many XP are gained over
                           time by players, to check if they are accumulating points at an
                           unfeasible rate. If the player becomes a suspect of cheating, then more
                           checks can be turned on for him.
