                                   size that can encode the expected length of the message. For example,
                                   if we expect the message to be always less than 255 bytes, we will use
                                   just one byte to encode the length. We use 2 bytes for messages that
                                   are expected to be less than 65535 bytes long, etc. However, if the
                                   message exceeds the expected size, we will fallback to using 4 bytes
                                   to encode the length. The above <span class="literal">WARNING</span> means that
                                   a message has exceeded the expected message length.

                                   longer than the normal 0.1 seconds. This can be due to many reasons
                                   but usually it is due to a script function taking a long time. You
                                   should ensure that your script code does not do anything that takes
                                   significant amount of time. You may have to break your processing into
                                   several runs by using a timer.

                                   seconds. This is bad because one tick should be less than 0.1

                        </p>
                        <p>This is usually caused by method calls to the entities located
                                   on the client i.e. entities in the AoI of the player or the player
                                   itself. If many method calls are made, or if the method calls are
                                   passing large arguments, then we will exceed the bandwidth allocation
                                   for the client. When bandwidth allocation is exceeded, the position
                                   updates send to the client is reduced so entity movements will become
                                   jerky.
