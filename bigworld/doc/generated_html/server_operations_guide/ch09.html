            <p>Security has been of paramount importance in the design and
                 implementation of all parts of BigWorld.
            </p>
            <p>The basic philosophy is to always handle with care any
                 client-initiated actions or messages. This should be accomplished in a way
                 that does not unduly limit potential game designs.

               <p>The internal network is assumed to be secure &#8212; BigWorld does not
                      implement security measures to safeguard processes against an attacker
                      gaining access to the cluster's internal LAN. Operators should ensure that
                      the usual protections for an internal network are in place. Remote access
                      should be very strictly controlled.
               </p>
               <p>The external points of contact are the area of most concern when
                      running an exposed server. For BigWorld, these are LoginApp and BaseApp,
                      as illustrated below:
               </p>
               <div class="informalfigure">
                  <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/bigworld_server_components.png"><span class="caption">
                        <p>BigWorld Server components</p></span></div>
               </div>
               <p>Due to the bandwidth needs of a massively multiplayer online game,
                      LoginApp and BaseApp are intended to be run on machines with external
                      access. In some sense they are the firewall. For more details, see <a href="ch09.html#xref_Blocking_Ports_And_Related_Security_Considerations" title="9.3.&nbsp;Blocking Ports and Related Security Considerations">Blocking Ports and Related Security Considerations</a>.
               </p>
               <p>LoginApp receives only fixed-length queries, making it easy and
                      transparent to secure. This process is expected to be tailored by
                      customers to suit their game, but care should be taken when doing
                      so.
               </p>
               <p>BaseApp receives more complex data, including script method calls,
                      and is the gateway to the rest of the BigWorld Server. It has many checks
                      in place to ensure the integrity of received data, and to discard (and
                      warn about) corrupted data and hacking attempts. The string CHEAT is used
                      in the log messages when BigWorld receives potentially malicious data that
                      does not conform to its protocols (the CellApp may also use this
                      indicator.) It is advised that MessageLogger logs be monitored for
                      messages containing that string (for details on MessageLogger, see <a href="ch03.html#xref_MessageLogger" title="3.2.1.&nbsp;MessageLogger">MessageLogger</a>).
               </p>
               <p>The security of the game-level logic rests to a certain extent with
                      the Python scripts that implement it. For example, an entity should not be
                      able to stab another entity that is 100 metres away. For more details on
                      this topic and on server features such as physics checking, see the

               <p>Since TCP/IP is not used externally, you can block all TCP traffic.
                      Leave all UDP/IP ports 32768 and above open, as well as the login port
                      (20013 by default).
               </p>
               <p>Use of a separate firewall machine is strongly discouraged. The
                      BaseApp machines are designed to be the firewalls themselves, and perform
                      a very similar proxying function for clients. Their amount of processing
                      is small enough so that they can handle a whole network adapter's worth of
                      Internet traffic. Adding another machine would only be a waste of
                      hardware, maintenance time, and latency. BaseApps only listen on one UDP
                      port &#8212; and so the whole TCP stack can be disabled on the external
                      interface. The use of standard firewall software such as iptables may be
                      an appropriate way to accomplish this.
               </p>
               <p>Network tools such as lsof and netstat should be consulted, to
                      ensure that you are not running any daemons listening on the external (or
                      common) interface. Apart from BWMachined, you should not need to run any
                      daemons with BigWorld, but if you wish to, then you should ensure that
                      their ports are blocked. BWMachined should not listen on the external
                      interface, only the internal interface.
               </p>
               <p>Barring all TCP packets greatly improves the security of a BaseApp
                      machine. TCP is a complicated protocol, and requires many tables and
                      buffers to implement or firewall. By this rationale, the security of a
                      BaseApp machine may be considered even better than that of an ordinary
                      firewall, which must conditionally pass TCP packets.
               </p>
               <p>To reduce exposure to DDOS attacks, it is recommended that the
                      BaseApp be left to choose, within the range allocated by the operating
                      system, a random port. This way, if an attacker discovers the IP and port
                      of one of the BaseApp machines, then it does not mean he will
                      automatically know those details for the other BaseApp machines.
