            <p>Mailboxes to entities residing on a BaseApp should exist for as long
               as they are needed. However, these same entities may be player entities
               controlled by the BigWorld client. These two different usages need to be
               reconciled when it comes to managing entity lifetimes &#8212; for example, if
               the client disconnects while the game's web interface is still using the
               player's base entity, this entity should not be destructed until the
                   game's web interface has finished with it.
            </p>
            <p>Another example is if the player is currently not logged in via the
                   BigWorld client. If the player does not explicitly log out, we would want
                   to clean up that mailbox reference after an inactivity period.
            </p>
            <p>A solution to this problem is to use a keep-alive interval for
                   mailboxes that require it, so that the entity stays around even if the
                   client has disconnected (destruction of the base entity is the normal
                   course of action). If a keep-alive interval is set on a mailbox, then each
                   time a method is called on that mailbox, it causes the keep-alive interval
                   for that entity to be refreshed.
            </p>
            <p>When a base entity enters a keep-alive interval, the base entity
                   script method <code class="methodname">onKeepAliveStart()</code> is called. When
                   the keep-alive interval expires without any refreshing from the web
                   integration gateway, it is assumed to be no longer required, and so
                   <code class="methodname">onKeepAliveStop()</code> is called in Python script. The
                   base entity script should decide whether it is still required, and should
                   destroy itself.
            </p>
            <p>Keep-alive intervals can be used with HTTP session timeouts so that
                   players have to re-login after a certain inactivity period to create a new
                   HTTP session. Keep-alive intervals should be set to be equal to session
                   durations or longer.
