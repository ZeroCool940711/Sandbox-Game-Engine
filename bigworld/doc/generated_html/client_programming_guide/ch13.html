            <p>A particle is a textured rectangle or a small mesh that can be drawn
                 quickly and simply, usually with an additive blend mode. They are mostly
                 used to create interesting graphical effects.
            </p>
            <p>Particles are managed within particle system objects, which keep track
                 of a number of particles with similar properties, and an identical function
                 pipeline to describe the transition of its particles' properties.

                  </div>
               </div>
               <p>The particle system is implemented in C++ and is accessible from
                      both the scripting environment and C++. The Python module for particle
                      systems is named Pixie.
               </p>
               <p>Each particle system is presently responsible for a set of particles
                      of the same texture. While a particle system can change its particle
                      texture colour dynamically, effects that require different simultaneous
                      textures require separate particle systems.
               </p>
               <p>A particle system is a conglomerate of the following:</p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul type="disc">
                     <li>
                        <p>Particles. This is a container that has specific allocation
                                   requirements determined by the renderer type. Currently there are
                                   contiguous particles, which have optimal insert/erase characteristics;
                                   and FixedIndex particles, these behave like a circular buffer and
                                   ensure that particle indices remain constant over their lifetime.
                                   FixedIndexParticles are a requirement for trail rendering and mesh
                                   particle rendering.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Particle Actions, which are responsible for the movement of
                                   particles (these actions do all the work of moving, creating and
                                   destroying each particle).
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Particle Renderer, which is in charge of drawing the
                                   particles.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>The Particle System itself provides a common access point for all
                      three objects.
               </p>
               <p>The Particle Renderer is for the most part hidden within the
                      particle system. Likewise, the particles themselves are inaccessible to
                      the outside. Most game code associated with the Particle System involves
                      the creation of special Particle Actions.
               </p>
               <p>Particle Actions work only during the update phase of the client.
                      They are called in turn during the tick method for a particle system, and
                      the combined actions of each produce the overall particle effect of the
                      system.
               </p>
               <p>For each particle system class, there is a corresponding python
                      wrapper class. For example, <span class="literal">MetaParticleSystem</span> is
                      wrapped by <span class="literal">PyMetaParticleSystem</span>. These python wrappers
                      hold no state, they only hold a smart pointer reference to the underlying
                      C++ object. The reason for this separation between the C++ object and
                      their python equivalent is to allow the full construction of particle
                      systems in the background thread (Python objects may only be constructed
                      in the main thread.)
               </p>
               <p>There is one more particle system class, which is the ChunkParticles
                      class. This is entirely C++ and implements a ChunkItem for particle
                      systems, it allows particle systems to be placed in the world via the
                      WorldEditor tool. Note that such particle systems should be automatically
                      time triggered, as there is no way to access them at run-time in python
                      and turn them on or off.
               </p>
               <p>At present, the procedure for using a particle system involves the
                      following steps:
               </p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul type="disc">
                     <li>
                        <p>Particle System is created using Particle Editor.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Particle Editor is used to create the different types of

                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Any texture and material effects are set.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Particle System is added to a model, in order to be displayed
                                   and updated.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>Particle Systems can easily be created in the BigWorld
                      ParticleEditor and saved as XML files &#8212; typically under folder the
                      resource tree <span class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;res&gt;</code></em></span>.
                      In the client, they can either be placed directly into the scene using the
                      World Editor, or invoked from Python as such:
               </p><pre class="programlisting">import Pixie
ps = Pixie.create( "my_particle_system.xml" )
BigWorld.player().model.node( "biped head" ).attach( ps )</pre><p>Note
                      that particle systems can take a reasonably long time to construct - for a
                      moderately complex system it might take 5ms to parse the xml file, create
                      all the subsystems and hook them all up together. For this reason, it is
                      highly recommended that the script-writer load Particle Systems
                      asynchronously, using either the Pixie.createBG method, the
                      BigWorld.loadResourceListBG method, or using Entity prerequisites. For
                      example:
               </p><pre class="programlisting">Example 1:

import Pixie
ps = Pixie.createBG( "my_particle_system.xml", self.onLoadPS )

                  <p>Source actions can create particles over regular periods of time,
                           on demand, or even be sensitive to the movement of the model to which it
                           is attached. The size, colour, velocity, position, and even age of the
                           particles can be specified upon creation. The key behind vector
                           descriptions of particles is the Vector Generation subsystem.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each source action requires three vector generators. A vector
                           generator is a class of objects that randomly create vectors within a
                           given space; the space is usually defined by the type of generator and
                           the parameters given to it. For example, a sphere generator may accept a
                           point in 3D space and a radius value, while a line generator may accept
                           two points in 3D space.
                  </p>
                  <p>The three generators are used to find the initial position,
                           velocity, and colour of the particle when created. When calculating
                           position and velocity, the local space of the model is taken into
                           account, but only for the creation of the particle. What this means is
                           that a cube described by two points, (-0.5, -0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5,
                           0.5) is roughly the bounding box of the particle in position.

                           be force, stream, barrier, and jitter.
                  </p>
                  <p>Basic movement of particles due to velocity is calculated
                           automatically within the particle system, taking wind also into

                  <p>Sink actions remove particles from the system, whether it is due
                           to age or for moving beyond a specified boundary. Examples of sink
                           actions are <em class="emphasis">sink</em>, <em class="emphasis">barrier,</em> and

               <p>To have a particle system follow a bone and orient to an external
                      target, you should attach it to a node, and then point that node using a
                      tracker.
               </p>
               <p>The tracker class provided by the BigWorld module (BigWorld.Tracker)
                      can be set up using a variety of DirectionProviders to point a node in the
                      appropriate direction:
               </p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul type="disc">

                        <p>Points a node towards the position given by a MatrixProvider

                                   entity, or to point in a constant world direction).
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><em class="emphasis"><span class="literal">ScanDirProvider</span></em></p>
                        <p>Makes a node swing back and forth around its Y-axis
                                   (<em class="emphasis">e.g.</em>, to simulate a security camera).
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>Depending on your particular game, you might not be able to use a
                      tracker to point a node on the source model. For example, the node may be
                      part of a character's skeleton and have some mesh rigged to it, so you may
                      not want to actually point to this bone (only the particle system attached
                      to it). If this is the case, then you will need to create a new node on
                      which to mount your particle system &#8212; ask your artists to build dummy
                      nodes into their models on which to mount FX.
               </p>
               <p>To have a particle system exist at a position that is not provided
                      by a bone, you should attach it to a separate model, and display the
                      separate model using <span class="literal">Entity.addModel</span>. Using
                      <span class="literal">Entity.addModel</span> instead of
                      <span class="literal">Entity.model.node(xxx).attach</span> means that the model
                      exists at location independent from the entity &#8212; in fact, it means that
                      nobody will be setting the position/direction of the model, and it is
                      entirely up to the script.
               </p>
               <p>Once you have an independent model, you can set its position and
                      orientation to any <span class="literal">MatrixProvider</span>, by using the
                      <span class="literal">Servo Motor</span>. As explained in the <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="olink">Client Python API
                         documentation</span>, the <span class="literal">Servo</span> class is a
                      <span class="literal">Motor</span> that sets the transform of a model to the given
                      <span class="literal">MatrixProvider</span> &#8212; as the
                      <span class="literal">MatrixProvider</span> is updated, the model moves. The signal
                      attribute is the <span class="literal">MatrixProvider</span> that sets the model's
                      transform.
               </p>
               <p>This way, you can use the <span class="literal">Servo</span>
                      <span class="literal">Motor</span> to move the model to a position provided by any
                      dynamic matrix. If the independent model has a node to point to, then you
                      can set its orientation by using a <span class="literal">Tracker</span>, as
                      explained above. This allows you to detach the position of a particle
                      system from a bone, but still set the orientation of the particle system
                      to the orientation of the bone, or towards an external target.
               </p>
               <p>Finally, if you want a particle system to exist at a fixed
                      point/orientation, then use the <span class="literal">ParticleSystem</span>'s
                      <span class="literal">explicitPosition</span> and
                      <span class="literal">explicitDirection</span> attributes. These set the
                      position/orientation of a particle system once, and cannot be set to
                      dynamic matrices. Note that if you use either attribute, you will need to
                      use both (setting either attribute tells the particle system that it is
                      using an 'explicit transform' derived from both attributes).
               </p>

                  <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                  <p>Be careful when attaching particle systems to bones! To attach a
                             particle system to a bone, a PyModelNode must be retrieved. If there
                             are no existing PyModelNodes referencing the bone you want to use,
                             then its transform is undefined until the next draw call. Since python
                             scripts are updated *before* the draw call, there is no way of knowing
                             where a node is at the time of first retrieval. Therefore in this
                             case, you should only attach a particle system to a PyModelNode when
                             you know it has been updated. Your possible options are :
                  </p>

                                          your model. This will ensure at a later date when a particle
                                          system is attached to that bone, that the bone's position is
                                          well-known.
