               <p>To log in, the client sends a UDP packet using Mercury to the login
                      server, on a well-known port. The packet contains all the account and
                      character information required to authenticate the client and select a
                      character.
               </p>
               <p>If login is successful, the login server adds an entity for the
                      character to the BigWorld server system, and refers the client to a proxy
                      server, which handles all in-game communication. Both sides then begin
                      sending data to each other. For more details on the login process, see the

               <p>A Mercury channel is created between the proxy and the client. Only
                      selected data that is classified as reliable is resent in the event of a
                      dropped packet. Due to the average packet rate, and the expected network
                      latency, a packet is classified as dropped if a packet with a higher
                      sequence number is received before it is.
               </p>
               <p>Since the client is operating in high-latency conditions, the server
                      does not wait for dropped packets to be resent before delivering other
                      pending information to the client. The client must therefore cope with
                      receiving out-of-order messages of all kinds.
               </p>
               <p>Messages are sent to the server through a
                      <span class="literal">ServerConnection</span> class. The position of the player is
                      sent to the server 10 times a second. Messages are received from the
                      server by this class during the input loop, and dispatched to their
                      handlers in the Entity Manager.

               <p>The bane of mass-market online gaming is the firewall, especially
                      the corporate ones. Our protocols have been designed to work smoothly
                      through all but the most paranoid of firewalls.
               </p>
               <p>From the firewall's point of view, it should appear that the client
                      has initiated both the login and the proxy packet streams &#8212; since the
                      login reply packet contains the address of the proxy server to send to,
                      the client can immediately begin sending data, which makes it appear to
                      the server it has initiated this stream too, <em class="emphasis">i.e.</em>, it
                      'punched a hole in the firewall'.
               </p>
               <p>The BigWorld server correctly handles the case where it sends data
                      to the client (which may be lost if the client is behind a firewall)
                      before the client has sent any data to it &#8212; the lost data is
                      resent.
               </p>
               <p>All that the firewall needs to support for these protocols to work
                      is the storing of a UDP reply mapping entry when it forwards an outgoing
                      packet, so that a when a reply packet arrives with exactly reversed
                      addresses (the source and destination IP and port are swapped from the
                      request packet), it is forwarded back to the requesting client. This is
                      the same requirement as that of the ubiquitous Internet Domain Name
                      Service (DNS), which practically all firewalls support.
               </p>
               <p>The BigWorld server does not require the client to make requests
                      from any particular port, so it is not confused if a firewall masquerades
                      the port as well as the IP.
