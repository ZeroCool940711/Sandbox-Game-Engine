            <p>Assets may also be loaded from specific requests issued by the
               scripted logic. For instance, when the player equips a special item for the
               first time, that item's model and texture will have to be in memory before
               it can be displayed. In these cases, if that resource is not already
                 resident, then the main thread will pause, waiting for the load request to

               <p>To prevent this kind of problems from creeping into the game,
                      BigWorld Client issues a warning in the debug output whenever an access to
                      disk is requested from the main thread while the 3D scene is visible (for
                      details, see the <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" class="olink">Client
                         Python API</span> documentation's entry <em class="emphasis">Modules

                      <em class="emphasis">Member Functions</em>, function <em class="emphasis"><span class="literal">BigWorld.worldDrawEnabled</span></em>).
                      Programmers are encouraged to fix these warnings as soon as they start to
                      pop-up.

            <p>The <span class="literal">prerequisites</span> function is the recommended
                 method of pre-loading the resources that may be required by the scripts (in
                 order to avoid pauses in the gameplay). It allows gameplay programmers to
                 specify which assets can potentially be used by an entity instance. It will
                 guarantee that the entity will not enter the world until all required
                 resources have been loaded from disk, and are ready to be used by the main
                 thread .

               <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
               <p>In a truly dynamic game environment it is not possible to anticipate
                      which resources will be requested by the scripts. In these cases,
                      <em class="emphasis"><span class="literal">BigWorld.loadResourceListBG</span></em> can
                      be used to load further resources.

               <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
               <p>Although the entity entry into the world may be delayed, that
                      usually is not noticeable, since most entities enter the player AoI at a
                      great distance. Even when that is not the case (after teleporting to a
                      location close to the player, for instance), that is still better than
                      pausing the game or having avatars swing invisible swords
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>The function differs from <span class="literal">preloads</span> by working on a
                 per-entity instance basis, instead of globally. That allows a much more
                 rational management of resources, since only assets with real potential of
                 being used are stored in memory at any one time.
                 <span class="literal">Preloads</span>, on the other hand, are kept in memory for the
                 whole life of the client application.
            </p>
            <p>The fact that <span class="literal">Prerequisites</span> works on a per-entity
                 instance basis, as opposed to per-entity type, allows programmers to
                 customize the prerequisites list depending on the state of the entity,
                 further adding to the efficiency of the system. When a non-player entity
                 enters the player AoI, for instance, only those items that the entity is
                 currently carrying would be required to load. The Entity Manager system
                 guarantees that the entity's properties are up-to-date before the
                 prerequisites list is requested.

               <p>The <span class="literal">prerequisites</span> function is, in fact, very
                      straightforward to use <span class="symbol">&#8208;</span> after an
                      entity is initialised, alongside its properties, but before the
                      <span class="literal">onEnterWorld</span> method is called, the Entity Manager calls
                      the <span class="literal">prerequisites</span> method on the entity. The method must
                      return a list of all assets that must be loaded before the entity enters
                      the world.
               </p>
               <p>A simple example is illustrated below:</p><pre class="programlisting">class TradeKiosk(BigWorld.Entity):
  MODEL = 'models\kiosk.model'

  def prerequisites(self): 
    # return list even if it is just a single file
    return [TradeKiosk.MODEL] 

  def onEnterWorld(self, prerequisites):
    self.model = prerequisites[TradeKiosk.MODEL]</pre><p><span class="citetitle">Simple example of load prerequisite
                         assets</span></p>
               <p>A more realistic scenario is when the required resources vary
                      according to the entity state. In this case, a single entity type is used
                      to model all types of pickable flowers. The <span class="literal">type</span>
                      property is used to differentiate each instance. Since
                      <span class="literal">type</span> is guaranteed to be initialised when the
                      <span class="literal">prerequisites</span> method is called, the script can
                      customise which resources are loaded. In this case, the type property will
                      not change over the lifetime of this particular entity, so we only need to
                      load resource once.
