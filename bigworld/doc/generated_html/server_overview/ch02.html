                     <p>The general goal is to produce a scalable, reliable, and efficient
                              system. This should be done while keeping as much simplicity and
                              flexibility as possible.

                     <p>The simplest design that satisfies all requirements should be
                              considered the best, or in the words of Einstein, "Make things as simple
                              as possible, but no simpler".

                     <p>In general (mainly when it comes to the client experience), the
                              worst case should be improved over the average case. For example, it is
                              not beneficial to have a blinding fast and accurate situation when a
                              client is not near a cell boundary if the experience is poor when he is
                              near one.

                                 valuable</em></p>
                     <p>The most important resource is the bandwidth between the client
                              and server. After this, it is probably CPU, and then intra-server
                              bandwidth.

                                 calls</em></p>
                     <p>Information (or data) that is often used together should be easily
                              accessed together. For example, a large amount of the data processed
                              together in the game is related to objects that are geometrically close.
                              It makes sense then to use data partitioning based on locality.
                     </p>
                     <p>It is also expensive to have to request information from a
                              separate server machine when it is necessary. This is true for a number
                              of reasons including the extra hops and coordination required and (maybe
                              even more importantly) the reduced likelihood of being able to batch
                              requests together.

                                 distributed</em></p>
                     <p>The design should try to avoid single central points where things
                              occur. This approach can cause performance bottlenecks and make the
                              design non-scalable. It can also introduce a single point of failure,
                              therefore raising fault tolerance issues.

                     <p>There is a fairly high overhead in sending a single packet. That
                              is, it is a lot more expensive to send ten individual packets than it is
                              to send one packet that is ten times bigger.
