               <p>The BaseApps and the LoginApps are the only server hardware that
                      needs to be connected to the Internet.
               </p>
               <p>For security purposes, it is recommended that the BaseApp and
                      LoginApp machines have two network cards; one to connect to the Internet,
                      and the other to connect to the rest of the server cluster.
               </p>
               <p>The diagram below shows the connection between the different
                      components of server hardware.

               <p>There is also a special daemon process called BWMachined, which runs

               </p>
               <p>In a production environment, each CellApp runs on its own machine,
                      as does each BaseApp. All other processes (apart from BWMachined) can be
                      organised to run in various combinations across one or more servers,
                      depending on system loads.
               </p>
               <p>In the hardware diagram above, LoginApp runs on its own machine(s),
                      directly connected to the Internet. The DBMgr also runs on its own
                      machine, whereas the CellAppMgr and BaseAppMgr both run on the World
                      server.

                  <p>Each CellApp is responsible for all cells running on it.</p>
                  <p>CellApps are probably the most important part of the architecture.
                           Each cell is responsible for either part of a large space or an entire
                           one. Within the game world, cells do not overlap, and collectively they
                           cover all game spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each cell is responsible for maintaining the entities located
                           within its boundaries. The entity is the basic element of operations
                           within the BigWorld game environment. Its distinguishing feature is its
                           point position in a space. A cell may also keep ghosts (copies) of
                           entities that are near, but outside its own boundary.
                  </p>

                  <p>In some respects, BaseApps can be seen as the firewalls for the
                           server.
                  </p>
                  <p>For the client, their main purpose is to isolate it from
                           transitions of its entity between CellApps.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each BaseApp contains many bases.</p>
                  <p>Connected clients are served by an enhanced base known as a proxy.
                           Each proxy is responsible for at most one client. Each client talks to
                           one proxy. This proxy is responsible for redirecting messages from the
                           client to the correct cell.
                  </p>
                  <p>In general, the BaseApp maintains bases. A base represents an
                           object or function that does not need to have a position in the
                           world.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, an object used for group chat is a base without a
                           corresponding cell entity.
                  </p>
                  <p>Any cell entity can have a corresponding base entity, giving it a
                           fixed point of contact in the game world.
                  </p>
                  <p>A base is also considered to be part of an entity, so a proxy is
                           the 'base entity' for a client, which will usually have a related 'cell
                           entity' part, as well as a 'client entity' part instantiated on any
                           clients that can see it.

                           provides this information to network users.

                           via a broadcast message. Its operation is similar to a CORBA Name

                  <p>As mentioned in <a href="ch05.html#xref_BWMachined" title="5.8.&nbsp;BWMachined">BWMachined</a>, BWMachined
                           runs on each machine in the server cluster, and is responsible for
                           monitoring the processes running on its machine.
                  </p>
                  <p>When a process starts up, it registers itself with the daemon
                           running on the local machine. The registration includes an interface

                  <p>Many processes need to know the location of other

                  </p>
                  <p>For example, a CellApp needs to know the location of a CellAppMgr,
                           so that it can register with it. So when CellApp starts up, it asks for
                           the location of a CellAppMgr by sending a broadcast message on
                           BWMachined's port, to which all BWMachined processes listen. If a
                           BWMachined has a CellAppMgr (associated with the correct user), it sends
                           the CellAppMgr's contact details as a response.

                           on the same cell. The solution to this is ghosting.
                  </p>
                  <p>A ghost is a copy of an entity from an adjacent cell. The ghost
                           copy contains all data that may be wanted when other entities are going
                           through their priority queues to construct their update packets. If
                           there is a possibility that an entity is within the AoI of another
                           entity in a different cell, it must have a ghost in that cell. To
                           achieve this, if an entity is within the AoI distance (or ghost
                           distance) of a cell boundary, BigWorld creates a ghost of the entity on
                           that cell.

                  <p>As an entity moves around, it may actually leave the boundary of
                           the cell it is currently on. When this occurs, the entity is moved to
                           the relevant new cell. It then informs the base of its new address, so
                           that the base can find it in the future (and in the case of a proxy, so
                           that the proxy can continue to forward messages correctly).

                  <p>A CellApp machine, like any other machine, has a limit to the load
                           it can handle. To avoid some CellApps getting overloaded, there is a
                           mechanism to balance the load. In general, if a cell is overloaded, then
                           it reduces its size, thus offloading some entities. If it is
                           underloaded, it increases its size to assume control of more entities.
