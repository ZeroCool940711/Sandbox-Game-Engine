                           of a failure.

                           client and server, and between all server components. It is based on
                           UDP, and allows both reliable and unreliable communications.

                  <p>The Nub is the core of Mercury. It is responsible for sending and
                           receiving packets, delivering timer messages, and general socket
                           notifications.
                  </p>
                  <p>Almost all communication uses UDP, a single socket is used for most
                           connections.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Nub normally controls the event loop of the application. So it
                           also provides a time queue, and user socket notifications. The time
                           queue can be used to invoke callbacks at a regular interval, or to
                           invoke a single callback after a timeout, if required. User sockets can
                           be monitored, and callbacks invoked when they are ready for
                           reading.

                  <p>A request is a message that expects an answer. It is possible to

                           without blocking the process' execution. Internally, Mercury will
                           allocate a unique request ID that is used to associate the reply with
                           the request. When a request is made, a reply handler is constructed to
                           handle the reply. It also handles timeouts, and will invoke a timeout
                           callback if no reply is received within a specified time.

                  <p>A bundle is a collection of messages that are sent and received as

                           the overhead of UDP headers. If a bundle exceeds the maximum packet
                           size, it will be split into multiple packets, and reassembled when it is
                           received.
                  </p>
                  <p>The maximum size of a packet is chosen based on efficiency and is
                           related to the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of a network. Each packet
                           in a bundle may optionally contain additional data,

                              characteristics</span></p>
                  <p>A channel's traits are specified when it is created, so that its
                           reliability algorithms can be appropriately selected.
                  </p>
                  <p>If any message in a packet is flagged as reliable, the entire
                           packet is also treated as reliable. The sender gives it a sequence
                           number, and stores it in a sliding window. The receiver acknowledges the
                           packet by placing an ACK on the next outgoing packet. Channels that have
                           regular bi-directional communication (e.g. 10Hz for client/server,
                           50Hz for CellApp/CellApp) do not send the ACK immediately while other
                           channels without regular communication will send this immediately.
                  </p>
                  <p>If the sender receives an out-of-order ACK, then it will assume
                           that the previous packets were lost, and resend them. For low-latency
                           connections, there is also a threshold in which packets will not be
                           resent for a certain time after they were previously sent.
                  </p>
                  <p>For low-bandwidth connections (client/server), all unreliable
                           messages are stripped from the packet before it is resent, and, if
                           possible, the packet is piggybacked on the next outgoing packet, in
                           order to save bandwidth.

                  <p>Incoming messages on a Nub are handled by a single interface.
                           Since the message type is a single byte, there can be up to 256
                           single-byte messages in an interface (actually, slightly less, since
                           Mercury reserves several messages for internal use and a lot more if
                           single-byte messages are multiplexed to more messages).
                  </p>
                  <p>Interfaces are normally defined using the macros in
                           <code class="filename">src/lib/network/interface_minder.hpp</code>. These are
                           designed to hide the details involved in decoding the message and
                           dispatching it. For simple fixed-length messages, the result is that
                           a method is called on an object, with a structure containing the
                           message parameters. For more complex variable-length messages, the
                           method is called with a stream object, and parameters must be streamed
                           off manually.
                  </p>
                  <p>Interfaces also define whether each message is variable or
                           fixed-length. For fixed-length messages, the size need not be sent,
                           since the receiver knows how many bytes to expect.

               <p>Each component of the server has been designed to be fault-tolerant.
                      Any of the server processes or machines can die unexpectedly, and the
                      server should continue with little impact. See the description of server
                      components for details about how each of them handles fault
                      tolerance.
               </p>
               <p>The BigWorld server also offers a second level of fault tolerance,
                      known as disaster recovery. The server's state can periodically be written
                      to the database. In the event of entire server failure, the server can be
                      restarted using this information.

               <p>XML files are used throughout BigWorld due to its flexibility and
                      ease of use. However, XML files are also widely regarded as being bloated
                      and, when used in a computer game, too easily modified by the end user.
                      Packed files are XML files converted to a more compact binary format. The
                      client and all server components are able to load packed files where it
                      usually expects an XML file. Replacing XML files with packed files will
                      improve performance and offer a degree of obfuscation that should deter
                      casual users from modifying the contents of the files.
               </p>
               <p>Packed files are read-only and are usually unsuitable for use during
                      development. Most of the tools (both client and server) will not work with
                      packed files due to its read-only nature.
