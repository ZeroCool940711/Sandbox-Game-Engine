               <p>From the client's perspective, there are conceptually four types of
                      action:
               </p>
               <div class="orderedlist">
                  <ol type="1">
                     <li>
                        <p><em class="emphasis">Server action</em></p>
                        <p>This is an unsolicited action that comes from the server, and is
                                   not generated by this client.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, another avatar jumping.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><em class="emphasis">Local action</em></p>
                        <p>This is an action that only occurs locally on the client, and
                                   does not need to be communicated to the server or other
                                   clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, special effects like particles bouncing or a flame
                                   slightly flaring.
                        </p>

                     <li>
                        <p><em class="emphasis">Undoable action</em></p>
                        <p>This is an action that the client takes immediately, under the
                                   assumption that it is correct, and then communicates to the server.
                                   The server has the ability to disallow the action and make the client
                                   rollback the action.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, the client stepping forward.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><em class="emphasis">Server-confirmed action</em></p>
                        <p>This is an action that needs to receive confirmation from the
                                   server to be performed on the client.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, the player wanting to shake hands with another
                                   player. Another example may be hitting a player (and thinking that it
                                   is dead) but not showing this until the server has confirmed it (this
                                   has some similarity to the Server action, except that the origin of
                                   the action was from this client).
                        </p>

                  </ol>

               <p>Many objects in the system will be publishers of data. Currently
                      there is an implicit publisher/subscriber relationship between the real
                      avatar (publisher) and its ghosts (subscribers). This can be generalised
                      so that anything can be a subscriber to an entity. This is also true for
                      bases.
               </p>
               <p>For example, a door subscribing to the bases of a button. When the
                      button changes state, the door reacts appropriately.
               </p>
               <p>Subscriptions can be implemented so that they have different
                      types.
               </p>
               <p>For example, in order to allow a player to see into another part of
                      the world, there might be the concepts of camera and screen. One way to
                      implement this would be for the camera to be similar to an avatar. When a
                      client is able to see a screen, it can subscribe to the camera with
                      different qualities of service (or bandwidth), depending on the screen
                      size. Another example is the door in the example above being implemented
                      as to react only to the button being pressed, but not being turned or
                      moved.
               </p>

               <p>The game designer needs to hide the latency from the player using as
                      many latency-hiding tricks as possible. There are two main sources of
                      latency:

               <div class="orderedlist">
                  <ol type="1">

                        <p><em class="emphasis">Internet latency</em></p>
                        <p>All information that travels between clients goes via the
                                   server, and so must have two trips on the Internet.

                     <li>
                        <p><em class="emphasis">Server latency</em></p>
                        <p>This is the time between information being received by the
                                   server, processing it, and responding back to the client. In an MMOG
                                   environment with large numbers of players, bandwidth is a precious
                                   resource, so not all new information can be sent out immediately. In
                                   BigWorld, the Priority Queue manages this.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ol>
               </div>
               <p>The Priority Queue can be tuned to reduce the latency on critical
                      information caused by the server. This does not affect the Internet
                      latency, though.
               </p>
               <p>Latency can also be introduced on the client side. This can occur if
                      the developer allows a delay between receiving data and sending it to the
                      server, or between receiving data and displaying it.
